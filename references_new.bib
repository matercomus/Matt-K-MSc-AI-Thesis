  abstract = {Synthetic data generation is a fundamental task for many data management and data science applications. Spatial data is of particular interest, and its sensitive nature often leads to privacy concerns. We introduce GeoPointGAN, a novel GAN-based solution for generating synthetic spatial point datasets with high utility and strong individual level privacy guarantees. GeoPointGAN's architecture includes a novel point transformation generator that learns to project randomly generated point co-ordinates into meaningful synthetic co-ordinates that capture both microscopic (e.g., junctions, squares) and macroscopic (e.g., parks, lakes) geographic features. We provide our privacy guarantees through label local differential privacy, which is more practical than traditional local differential privacy. We seamlessly integrate this level of privacy into GeoPointGAN by augmenting the discriminator to the point level and implementing a randomized response-based mechanism that flips the labels associated with the `real' and `fake' points used in training. Extensive experiments show that GeoPointGAN significantly outperforms recent solutions, improving by up to 10 times compared to the most competitive baseline. We also evaluate GeoPointGAN using range, hotspot, and facility location queries, which confirm the practical effectiveness of GeoPointGAN for privacy-preserving querying. The results illustrate that a strong level of privacy is achieved with little-to-no adverse utility cost, which we explain through the generalization and regularization effects that are realized by flipping the labels of the data during training.},

  abstract = {Location and trajectory data are routinely collected to generate valuable knowledge about users' pattern behavior. However, releasing location data may jeopardize the privacy of the involved individuals. Differential privacy is a powerful technique that prevents an adversary from inferring the presence or absence of an individual in the original data solely based on the observed data. The first challenge in applying differential privacy in location is that a it usually involves a single user. This shifts the adversary's target to the user's locations instead of presence or absence in the original data. The second challenge is that the inherent correlation between location data, due to people's movement regularity and predictability, gives the adversary an advantage in inferring information about individuals. In this paper, we review the differentially private approaches to tackle these challenges. Our goal is to help newcomers to the field to better understand the state-of-the art by providing a research map that highlights the different challenges in designing differentially private frameworks that tackle the characteristics of location data. We find that in protecting an individual's location privacy, the attention of differential privacy mechanisms shifts to preventing the adversary from inferring the original location based on the observed one. Moreover, we find that the privacy-preserving mechanisms make use of the predictability and regularity of users' movements to design and protect the users' privacy in trajectory data. Finally, we explore how well the presented frameworks succeed in protecting users' locations and trajectories against well-known privacy attacks.},

In this paper, we propose the use of federated learning for taxidemand prediction that allows multiple parties to train a machine learning model on their own data while keeping the data private and secure. This can enable organizations to build models on data they otherwise would not be able to access. Evaluation with real-world data collected from 16 taxi service providers in Japan over a period of six months showed that the proposed system can predict the demand level accurately within 1\% error compared to a single model trained with integrated data.},

  abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of GPS positioning and wireless communication, more and more trajectories are collected. How to accurately and efficiently detect abnormal trajectories from a large number of trajectories has become a focused issue. The similarity measurement method adopted by the existing abnormal trajectory detection technology often ignores the situation that the abnormal sub-trajectory has enough neighbors. If a trajectory is composed of multiple such subtrajectories, this anomaly will not be detected. At present, the trajectory outlier detection algorithm based on common slices sub-sequence(T ODCSS) has improved the above problems. However, it is not accurate enough in feature extraction. Its detection scope is limited to 2D-plane and the time dimension is ignored, so it can't detect abnormal vehicle behaviors such as multiple stops, detention, too slow speed and so on. Based on the above problems, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal trajectory anomaly detection based on common sub-sequence (ST ADCS). Firstly, in order to obtain accurate and reasonable similar trajectories, the length of sub-trajectory is added to the common sequence of trajectories, and non-common parts between two trajectories are added to the similarity measurement. Then the time is added to detect trajectories of time anomalies. It improves the accuracy and rationality of detection. Finally, we conducted experiments on real datasets and used F 1 - measure to evaluate the accuracy of this algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, the accuracy of ST ADCS is improved by about 15.15\%.},

  abstract = {Human mobility modeling from GPS-trajectories and synthetic trajectory generation are crucial for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster management and epidemiology. Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98\% of spatial accuracy on average.},

  abstract = {Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Taxi services have long faced difficulties with unethical taxi drivers taking detours, especially when passengers are unfamiliar with their surroundings. Therefore, it is important to monitor taxis' operation to enhance the quality of taxi services. In this paper, we mainly study the anomaly detection of taxi trajectories in the spatial dimension with a novel taxi anomaly detection framework based on real-time vehicle trajectory prediction. The framework is termed as TAPS and consists of two stages: the offline training stage and the online anomaly detection stage. In the first stage, a vehicle prediction model is established by training recommended routes provided by a navigation platform to predict a taxi's next locations. The second step is to detect the taxi's anomalous trajectories by measuring the consistency between its current and predicted positions as well as the relationship between these two positions and the origin. The effectiveness and timeliness of TAPS are evaluated in a real-world case study. The experiment results show that compared with two baselines, TAPS achieves greater Accuracy, Precision and F1 score to detect anomalous trajectories. This proposed framework can serve as a fundamental tool to detect anomalous trajectories for taxi passengers and companies.},

However, there are limitations in the existing field, including open-source data being in various formats and difficult to use, few papers making their code and data openly available, and open-source models often using different frameworks and platforms, making comparisons challenging. A standardized framework is urgently needed to implement and evaluate these methods. To address these issues, we propose LibCity, an open-source library that offers researchers a credible experimental tool and a convenient development framework. In this library, we have reproduced 65 spatial-temporal prediction models and collected 55 spatial-temporal datasets, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive experiments conveniently. By enabling fair model comparisons, designing a unified data storage format, and simplifying the process of developing new models, LibCity is poised to make significant contributions to the spatial-temporal prediction field.},

  abstract = {Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) is a powerful tool for spatial-temporal data analysis and management. TRL aims to convert complicated raw trajectories into low-dimensional representation vectors, which can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as trajectory classification, clustering, and similarity computation. Existing TRL works usually treat trajectories as ordinary sequence data, while some important spatial-temporal characteristics, such as temporal regularities and travel semantics, are not fully exploited. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Self-supervised trajectory representation learning framework with TemporAl Regularities and Travel semantics, namely START. The proposed method consists of two stages. The first stage is a Trajectory Pattern-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (TPE-GAT), which converts the road network features and travel semantics into representation vectors of road segments. The second stage is a Time-Aware Trajectory Encoder (TAT-Enc), which encodes representation vectors of road segments in the same trajectory as a trajectory representation vector, meanwhile incorporating temporal regularities with the trajectory representation. Moreover, we also design two self-supervised tasks, i.e., span-masked trajectory recovery and trajectory contrastive learning, to introduce spatial-temporal characteristics of trajectories into the training process of our START framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets for three downstream tasks. The experiments also demonstrate that our method can be transferred across different cities to adapt heterogeneous trajectory datasets.},

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets (i.e., METR-LA and PEMS-BAY) and a new large-scale traffic speed dataset called EXPY-TKY that covers 1843 expressway road links in Tokyo. Our model outperformed the stateof-the-arts on all three datasets. Besides, through a series of qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our model can explicitly disentangle the road links and time slots with different patterns and be robustly adaptive to any anomalous traffic situations.

Existing public log datasets suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage, (2) lack of authenticity in static analysis-based automated generation frameworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework for anomaly detection. The framework features a novel four-phase architecture that synergistically combines enhanced program analysis with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable iterative log generation and anomaly annotation without requiring actual system execution. Experimental evaluations on Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves significantly higher log event coverage (38{\texttimes}--95{\texttimes} improvement over existing datasets) and generates more realistic log sequences compared to static analysis-based tools. When augmenting benchmark datasets with AnomalyGen-generated data, we observe up to 3.7\% improvement in F1-score (1.8\% average improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This work establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated log analysis and pioneers a new paradigm for LLM applications in software engineering.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of sensor technology has resulted in a vast volume of traffic trajectory data, and trajectory anomaly detection has a wide range of applications in sectors including smart transportation, autonomous driving, and video surveillance. Trajectory anomaly detection, unlike other trajectory mining tasks like classification, clustering, and prediction, tries to find low-probability, uncertain, and unusual trajectory behavior. The types of anomalies, trajectory data labels, detection accuracy, and computational complexity are all frequent issues in trajectory anomaly detection. In view of the above problems, the research status and latest progress of trajectory anomaly detection technology in the past two decades are comprehensively reviewed. First, the characteristics of trajectory anomaly detection and the current research challenges are analyzed. Then, the existing trajectory anomaly detection algorithms are compared and analyzed based on the classification criteria such as the availability of trajectory labels, the principle of anomaly detection algorithms, and the working mode of offline or online algorithms. For each type of anomaly detection technology, the algorithm principle, representative method, complexity analysis and algorithm advantages and disadvantages are summarized and analyzed in detail. Then, the open source trajectory datasets, commonly used anomaly detection evaluation methods and anomaly detection tools are discussed. On this basis, the architecture of the trajectory anomaly detection system is presented, and a series of relatively complete trajectory mining processes from trajectory data collection to anomaly detection application are formed. Finally, the significant open issues in the domain of trajectory anomaly detection are discussed, as well as potential research trends and solutions.},

  abstract = {Vehicle trajectory anomaly detection plays an essential role in the fields of traffic video surveillance, autonomous driving navigation, and taxi fraud detection. Deep generative models have been shown to be promising solutions for anomaly detection, avoiding the costs involved in manual labeling. However, existing popular generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) are often plagued by training instability, mode collapse, and poor sample quality. To resolve the dilemma, we present DiffTAD, a novel vehicle trajectory anomaly detection framework based on the emerging diffusion models. DiffTAD formalizes anomaly detection as a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the vehicle trajectory until the path is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The core idea of our framework is to devise deep neural networks to learn the reverse of the diffusion process and to detect anomalies by comparing the difference between a query trajectory and its reconstruction. DiffTAD is a parameterized Markov chain trained with variational inference and allows the mean square error to optimize the reweighted variational lower bound. In addition, DiffTAD integrates decoupled Transformer-based temporal and spatial encoders to model the temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among vehicles in the diffusion models. Experiments on the real-world trajectory dataset TRAFFIC demonstrate that our DiffTAD achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with the maximum enhancements reaching 25.87\% and 35.59\% in terms of AUC and F1. While on the synthetic datasets CROSS, SynTra, and MAAD, the maximum improvements in AUC/F1 are 27.47\%/38.56\%, 25.38\%/31.42\%, and 58.22\%/50.04\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey ({\S}ADGDM) aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.},

  abstract = {With the rapid advancement of social economies, intelligent transportation systems are gaining increasing attention. Central to these systems is the detection of abnormal vehicle behavior, which remains a critical challenge due to the complexity of urban roadways and the variability of external conditions. Current research on detecting abnormal traffic behaviors is still nascent, with significant room for improvement in recognition accuracy. To address this, this research has developed a new model for recognizing abnormal traffic behaviors. This model employs the R3D network as its core architecture, incorporating a dense block to facilitate feature reuse. This approach not only enhances performance with fewer parameters and reduced computational demands but also allows for the acquisition of new features while simplifying the overall network structure. Additionally, this research integrates a self-attentive method that dynamically adjusts to the prevailing traffic conditions, optimizing the relevance of features for the task at hand. For temporal analysis, a Bi-LSTM layer is utilized to extract and learn from time-based data nuances. This research conducted a series of comparative experiments using the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving a notable accuracy of 89.30\% on our test set. Our results demonstrate that our model not only operates with fewer parameters but also achieves superior recognition accuracy compared to previous models.},

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) and the semantic enrichment of mobility data in several contexts in the last few years has led to the generation of large volumes of trajectory data. In contrast to GPS-based trajectories, LBSN and context-aware trajectories are more complex data, having several semantic textual dimensions besides space and time, which may reveal interesting mobility patterns. For instance, people may visit different places or perform different activities depending on the weather conditions and their geographical location. Animals may choose their habitat based on climate and vegetation characteristics. These new semantically rich data, known as multiple-aspect trajectories, pose new challenges in trajectory classification, which is the problem that we address in this paper. Existing methods for trajectory classification cannot deal with the complexity of heterogeneous data dimensions or the sequential aspect that characterizes movement. In this paper we propose MARC, an approach based on attribute embedding and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for classifying multiple-aspect trajectories, that tackles all trajectory properties: space, time, semantics, and sequence. We highlight that MARC exhibits good performance especially when trajectories are described by several textual/categorical attributes. Experiments performed over four publicly available datasets considering the Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) problem show that MARC outperformed all competitors in all datasets, with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.

  abstract = {Accurate taxi-demand prediction is essential for optimizing taxi operations and enhancing urban transportation services. However, using customers' data in these systems raises significant privacy and security concerns. Traditional federated learning addresses some privacy issues by enabling model training without direct data exchange but often struggles with accuracy due to varying data distributions across different regions or service providers. In this paper, we propose CC-Net: a novel approach using collaborative learning enhanced with contrastive learning for taxi-demand prediction. Our method ensures high performance by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train a demand-prediction model through hierarchical federated learning. In this approach, similar parties are clustered together, and federated learning is applied within each cluster. The similarity is defined without data exchange, ensuring privacy and security. We evaluated our approach using real-world data from five taxi service providers in Japan over fourteen months. The results demonstrate that CC-Net maintains the privacy of customers' data while improving prediction accuracy by at least 2.2\% compared to existing techniques.},

In this paper, we propose a profitable taxi route recommendation method called adaptive shortest expected cruising route (ASER). In ASER, a probabilistic network model is developed to predict pick-up probability and capacity of each location by using Kalman filtering method. To recommend profitable driving routes to taxi drivers, ASER takes the load balance between passengers and taxis into consideration and the shortest expected cruising distance is introduced to formulate potential cruising distance of taxis. Moreover, MapReduce and a novel data structure kdS-tree are applied to improve recommendation efficiency. ASER is evaluated on two real trajectory datasets from San Francisco, CA, USA, and Wuhan, China. The experimental results validate that ASER significantly outperforms the existing methods by reducing the taxi cruising distance 11\% and 39\%.},

However, the dynamic environments where the networks operate disallow the traditional assumptions required to put in practice many off-the-shelf supervised learning algorithms, such as finite training sets or stationary distributions. In this paper, we propose BRIGHT: a drift-aware supervised learning framework to predict demand quantities. BRIGHT aims to provide accurate predictions for short-term horizons through a creative ensemble of time series analysis methods that handles distinct types of concept drift. By selecting neighborhoods dynamically, BRIGHT reduces the likelihood of overfitting. By ensuring diversity among the base learners, BRIGHT ensures a high reduction of variance while keeping bias stable. Experiments were conducted using three large-scale heterogeneous real-world transportation networks in Porto (Portugal), Shanghai (China), and Stockholm (Sweden), as well as with controlled experiments using synthetic data where multiple distinct drifts were artificially induced. The obtained results illustrate the advantages of BRIGHT in relation to state-of-the-art methods for this task.},

  abstract = {Travel time prediction of a given trajectory plays an indispensable role in intelligent transportation systems. Although many prior researches have struggled for accurate prediction results, most of them achieve inferior performance due to insufficient feature extraction of travel speed and road network structure from the trajectory data, which confirms the challenges involved in this topic. To overcome those issues, we propose a novel neural Network for Travel Time Prediction based on tensor decomposition and graph embedding, named TTPNet, which can extract travel speed and representation of road network structure effectively from historical trajectories, as well as predict the travel time with better accuracy. Specifically, TTPNet consists of three components: the first module (Travel Speed Features Layer) leverages non-negative tensor decomposition to restore travel speed distributions on different roads in the previous hour, and integrates a CNN-RNN model to extract both long-term and short-term travel speed features of the query trajectory; the second module (Road Network Structure Features Layer) utilizes graph embedding to generate the representation of local and global road network structure; the last module (Deep LSTM Prediction Layer) completes the final predicting task. Empirical results over two real-world large-scale datasets show that our proposed TTPNet model can achieve significantly better performance and remarkable robustness.},

Generating synthetic data by applying pre-determined transformations that conform to a set of known invariances has shown to improve performance of such deep models. In this work we present C-GATS to show that one can learn a much larger invariance space using the available sparse data by training a conditional generative model to do Data Augmentation (DA) for anomalous Time Series (TS) in a model-agnostic way. Particularly, we factorize an anomalous TS sequence into 3 attributes--- normal sub-sequence, anomalous sub-sequence, and position of the anomaly and model each of them separately. This factorization helps exploit samples from the dominant class i.e normal TS to train a generative model for the sparse class i.e anomalous TS. We provide an exhaustive study to showcase that C-GATS not only learns to generate different types of anomalies (eg: point anomalies and level-shift) but those generated anomalies improve performance of multiple SOTA TS AD models on a set of popular public TS AD benchmark datasets.},

Current traffic monitoring systems often rely on single data sources, which limits their detection accuracy and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on multimodal deep fusion and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs), incorporating an Ensemble Contrastive Pessimistic Likelihood Estimation (CPLE) algorithm to optimize performance. The framework integrates static and dynamic traffic data, such as video images, traffic flow, vehicle speed, and tunnel weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the model performs well in various scenarios, showing significant improvement in accuracy and stability over existing models like AGC-LSTM and AttentionDeepST. For instance, the proposed MHGNN-CPLE model achieves superior accuracy and F1 score in static detection tasks while maintaining high accuracy under different noise levels in dynamic detection scenarios. This study provides a significant advancement in traffic event analysis by effectively combining multimodal data and leveraging HGNNs to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies.},

  abstract = {Trajectory anomalies serve as early indicators of potential issues and frequently provide valuable insights into event occurrence. Existing methods for detecting abnormal trajectories primarily focus on comparing the spatial characteristics of the trajectories. However, they fail to capture the temporal dimension's pattern and evolution within the trajectory data, thereby inadequately identifying the behavioral inertia of the target group. A few detection methods that incorporate spatiotemporal features have also failed to adequately analyze the spatiotemporal sequence evolution information; consequently, detection methods that ignore temporal and spatial correlations are too one-sided. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially gate recurrent unit (GRU) that design reset and update gate control units, process nonlinear sequence processing capabilities, enabling effective extraction and analysis of both temporal and spatial characteristics. However, the basic GRU network model has limited expressive power and may not be able to adequately capture complex sequence patterns and semantic information. To address the above issues, an abnormal trajectory detection method based on the improved GRU model is proposed in cloud computing in this paper. To enhance the anomaly detection ability and training efficiency of relevant models, strictly control the input of irrelevant features and improve the model fitting effect, an improved model combining the random forest algorithm and fully connected layer network is designed. The method deconstructs spatiotemporal semantics through reset and update gated units, while effectively capturing feature evolution information and target behavioral inertia by leveraging the integration of features and nonlinear mapping capabilities of the fully connected layer network. The experimental results based on the GeoLife GPS trajectory dataset indicate that the proposed approach improves both generalization ability by 1\% and reduces training cost by 31.68\%. This success do provides a practical solution for the task of anomaly trajectory detection.},

These services provide new prospects for users: getting directions to work in the morning, leaving a check-in at a restaurant at noon and checking next day's weather in the evening are possible right from any mobile device embedding a GPS chip. In these location-based applications, the user's location is sent to a server, which uses them to provide contextual and personalised answers. However, nothing prevents the latter from gathering, analysing and possibly sharing the collected information, which opens the door to many privacy threats. Indeed, mobility data can reveal sensitive information about users, among which one's home, work place or even religious and political preferences. For this reason, many privacy-preserving mechanisms have been proposed these last years to enhance location privacy while using geolocated services. This article surveys and organises contributions in this area from classical building blocks to the most recent developments of privacy threats and location privacy-preserving mechanisms. We divide the protection mechanisms between online and offline use cases, and organise them into six categories depending on the nature of their algorithm. Moreover, this article surveys the evaluation metrics used to assess protection mechanisms in terms of privacy, utility and performance. Finally, open challenges and new directions to address the problem of computational location privacy are pointed out and discussed.},

These anomalous driving trajectories provide us an opportunity to extract driver or passenger behaviors and monitor adverse urban traffic events. Because various trajectory clustering methods have previously proven to be an effective means to analyze similarities and anomalies within taxi GPS trajectory data, we focus on the problem of detecting anomalous taxi trajectories, and we develop our trajectory clustering method based on the edit distance and hierarchical clustering. To achieve this objective, first, we obtain all the taxi trajectories crossing the same source--destination pairs from taxi trajectories and take these trajectories as clustering objects. Second, an edit distance algorithm is modified to measure the similarity of the trajectories. Then, we distinguish regular trajectories and anomalous trajectories by applying adaptive hierarchical clustering based on an optimal number of clusters. Moreover, we further analyze these anomalous trajectories and discover four anomalous behavior patterns to speculate on the cause of an anomaly based on statistical indicators of time and length. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect anomalous trajectories and can be used to infer clearly fraudulent driving routes and the occurrence of adverse traffic events.},

Numerous existing models focus on short-term traffic forecasts, but effective long-term forecasting of traffic flows have become a challenging issue in recent years. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a deep learning architecture which consisting of two parts: the long short-term memory encoder-decoder structure at the bottom and the calibration layer at the top. In the encoder-decoder model, we propose an hard attention mechanism based on learning similar patterns to enhance neuronal memory and reduce the accumulation of error propagation. To correct some of the missing details, we design a control gate in the calibration layer to learn the predicted data in groups according to different forms. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. It is verified that our model can accurately learn local feature and long-term dependence, and has better accuracy and stability in long-term sequence prediction.},

Moreover, in most current methods, trajectories are represented by geometric features or their low-dimensional linear combination, and some hidden features and high-dimensional combined features cannot be found efficiently. Meanwhile, traditional methods still cannot get rid of the limitation of space attributes. Therefore, a novel trajectory anomaly detection algorithm is present in this article. Unsupervised learning mechanism is used to overcome nonground-truth problem and deep representation method is used to represent trajectories in a comprehensive way. First, each trajectory is partitioned into segments according to its open angles, then the shallow features at each point of a segment are extracted and. In this way, each segment is represented as a feature sequence. Second, shallow features are integrated into auto-encoder-based deep feature fusion model, and the fusion feature sequences can be extracted. Third, these fused feature sequences are grouped into different clusters using a unsupervised clustering algorithm, and then segments which quite differ from others are detected as anomalies. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency of our work.},

  abstract = {Estimating the travel time of any path (denoted by a sequence of connected road segments) in a city is of great importance to traffic monitoring, route planning, ridesharing, taxi/Uber dispatching, etc. However, it is a very challenging problem, affected by diverse complex factors, including spatial correlations, temporal dependencies, external conditions (e.g. weather, traffic lights). Prior work usually focuses on estimating the travel times of individual road segments or sub-paths and then summing up these times, which leads to an inaccurate estimation because such approaches do not consider road intersections/traffic lights, and local errors may accumulate. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Deep learning framework for Travel Time Estimation (called DeepTTE) that estimates the travel time of the whole path directly. More specifically, we present a geo-convolution operation by integrating the geographic information into the classical convolution, capable of capturing spatial correlations. By stacking recurrent unit on the geo-convoluton layer, our DeepTTE can capture the temporal dependencies as well. A multi-task learning component is given on the top of DeepTTE, that learns to estimate the travel time of both the entire path and each local path simultaneously during the training phase. Extensive experiments on two trajectory datasets show our DeepTTE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Trajectory data is essential for various applications as it records the movement of vehicles. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, {\textbackslash}emph\{i.e.\}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a short-term traffic flow prediction model that combines community detection-based federated learning with a graph convolutional network (GCN) to alleviate the time-consuming training, higher communication costs, and data privacy risks of global GCNs as the amount of data increases. The federated community GCN (FCGCN) can achieve timely, accurate, and safe traffic state predictions in the era of big traffic data, which is critical for the efficient operation of intelligent transportation systems. The FCGCN prediction process has four steps: dividing the local subnetwork with community detection, local training based on the global parameters, uploading the local model parameters, and constructing a global model prediction based on the aggregated parameters. Numerical results on the PeMS04 and PeMS08 datasets show that the FCGCN outperforms four benchmark models, namely, the long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), ChebNet, and graph attention network (GAT) models. The FCGCN prediction is closer to the real value, with nearly the same performance as the global model at a lower time cost, thus achieving accurate and secure short-term traffic flow predictions with three parameters: flow, speed, and occupancy.},

In this paper, we aim to discover anomalous driving patterns from taxi's GPS traces, targeting applications like automatically detecting taxi driving frauds or road network change in modern cites. To achieve the objective, firstly we group all the taxi trajectories crossing the same sourcedestination cell-pair and represent each taxi trajectory as a sequence of symbols. Secondly, we propose an IsolationBased Anomalous Trajectory (iBAT) detection method and verify with large scale taxi data that iBAT achieves remarkable performance (AUC{$>$}0.99, over 90\% detection rate at false alarm rate of less than 2\%). Finally, we demonstrate the potential of iBAT in enabling innovative applications by using it for taxi driving fraud detection and road network change detection.},

  abstract = {Pervasive integration of GPS-enabled devices and data acquisition technologies has led to an exponential increase in GPS trajectory data, fostering advancements in spatial-temporal data mining research. Nonetheless, GPS trajectories contain personal geolocation information, rendering serious privacy concerns when working with raw data. A promising approach to address this issue is trajectory generation, which involves replacing original data with generated, privacy-free alternatives. Despite the potential of trajectory generation, the complex nature of human behavior and its inherent stochastic characteristics pose challenges in generating high-quality trajectories. In this work, we propose a spatial-temporal diffusion probabilistic model for trajectory generation (DiffTraj). This model effectively combines the generative abilities of diffusion models with the spatial-temporal features derived from real trajectories. The core idea is to reconstruct and synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise through a reverse trajectory denoising process. Furthermore, we propose a Trajectory UNet (Traj-UNet) deep neural network to embed conditional information and accurately estimate noise levels during the reverse process. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that DiffTraj can be intuitively applied to generate high-fidelity trajectories while retaining the original distributions. Moreover, the generated results can support downstream trajectory analysis tasks and significantly outperform other methods in terms of geo-distribution evaluations.},
