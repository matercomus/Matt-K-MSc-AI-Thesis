## 📋 Ingredients (Prerequisites)

### Required Components:
1. **Base Dataset**: Original taxi trajectory data (Beijing, Chengdu, Xi'an format)
2. **DiffTraj Model**: Pre-trained trajectory generation model
3. **LM-TAD Model**: Language model for trajectory anomaly detection
4. **Computing Resources**: GPU with sufficient memory for iterative training

### Literature Validation:
> **Mbuya et al. (2024)**: "Both DiffTraj and LM-TAD work with the same underlying GPS trajectory datasets" - confirms technical compatibility

## 🧑‍🍳 Step-by-Step Recipe

### **STEP 1: Baseline Anomaly Extraction** 
*Literature Foundation: Rule-based curation approach*

**What to Do:**
1. Apply LM-TAD to original taxi dataset
2. Extract trajectories with **high perplexity scores** (top 5-10%)
3. Categorize anomalies by type (spatial, temporal, behavioral)
4. Create labeled anomaly subset

**Research Support:**
> **Mbuya et al. (2024)**: "LM-TAD uses perplexity and surprisal metrics for anomaly detection" - validates extraction method

**Critical Warning:**
⚠️ **DO NOT** replace original data. Keep anomalies as **additional dataset** only.

> **Gerstgrasser et al. (2024)**: "Accumulating successive generations of synthetic data alongside original real data avoids model collapse"

---

### **STEP 2: Data Mixing Strategy**
*Literature Foundation: Model collapse prevention*

**Recipe Proportions:**
- **75-80%**: Original real trajectory data
- **20-25%**: Enhanced anomalous trajectories  
- **<5%**: Completely synthetic anomalies (if any)

**Research Support:**
> **Seddik et al. (2024)**: "Mixing both real and synthetic data" with controlled ratios prevents degradation

> **Gerstgrasser et al. (2024)**: "Test error is upper bounded regardless of iterations" when accumulating rather than replacing data

**Implementation:**
```python
# Pseudocode for data mixing
enhanced_dataset = {
    'original_real': 0.75,
    'curated_anomalies': 0.20, 
    'synthetic_anomalies': 0.05
}
```

### **STEP 3: Enhanced DiffTraj Retraining**
*Literature Foundation: Stable iterative training*

**Training Protocol:**
1. **Use token-level editing** instead of full generation
2. **Implement gradient stabilization** techniques
3. **Monitor loss convergence** at each iteration
4. **Apply early stopping** if instability detected

**Research Support:**
> **Zhu et al. (2024)**: "Token-level editing" approach maintains quality better than full generation

> **Chen et al. (2024)**: "Stabilized training of diffusion transformers" - provides stability techniques

**Critical Implementation Details:**
- **Learning Rate**: Start with 50% of original rate
- **Batch Size**: Maintain consistent batch composition ratios
- **Iterations**: Maximum 3-5 refinement cycles

**Research Warning:**
> **Seddik et al. (2024)**: "Exponential scaling in data requirements" - avoid excessive iterations

---

### **STEP 4: Quality Assurance Testing**
*Literature Foundation: Detection accuracy maintenance*

**Testing Protocol:**
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Test LM-TAD on original dataset
2. **Enhanced Testing**: Test LM-TAD on synthetically enhanced dataset  
3. **Accuracy Metrics**: Compare detection precision, recall, F1-score
4. **Stability Metrics**: Monitor false positive rates

**Expected Results (Literature-Based):**
- **Detection Accuracy**: Should maintain ≥95% of baseline performance
- **False Positives**: Should not increase >10% from baseline

**Research Support:**
> **Gerstgrasser et al. (2024)**: "Test error is upper bounded" when using accumulation strategy

> **Multi-modal Training Research (Hu et al., 2024)**: Demonstrates maintained performance across modalities

---

### **STEP 5: Iterative Refinement (Optional)**
*Literature Foundation: Controlled iteration*

**IF Step 4 results are satisfactory:**
1. **Generate new anomalies** using enhanced DiffTraj
2. **Apply quality filtering** using LM-TAD scoring
3. **Add highest-quality samples** to dataset (maintain ratios from Step 2)
4. **Repeat Steps 3-4** (maximum 2 additional cycles)

**Research Support:**
> **Zhu et al. (2024)**: "Avoid the pitfalls of naive iterative training" through quality control

**Stop Conditions:**
- Detection accuracy drops >5%
- Training loss becomes unstable
- Generated trajectories show mode collapse

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **Research-Backed Warnings:**

**❌ DON'T Replace Original Data**
> **Gerstgrasser et al. (2024)**: "Replacing original real data tends towards model collapse"

**❌ DON'T Exceed 25% Synthetic Content**  
> **Seddik et al. (2024)**: Higher ratios require "exponential scaling in data requirements"

**❌ DON'T Skip Stability Monitoring**
> **Chen et al. (2024)**: "Stabilized training" requires continuous monitoring

**❌ DON'T Iterate Indefinitely**
> **Zhu et al. (2024)**: "Avoid the pitfalls of naive iterative training"
