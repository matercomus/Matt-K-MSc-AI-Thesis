## Remarks

### Ronald:
Q: ensure that feedeg back anomalous data, generating new and detecting anomalies again will work. Will the anomalies still be considered anomalies if they are 50% of the dataset?

A: We do not retrain DiffTraj on the nomalous set we just keep generating Until we have as amny as normal data points as after filtering potential anoalies from the first synthetic dataset.

- Prepare a high level proces diagram with in and outputs.


### Shuai
Q: Consider if DiffTraj is suitable. Check code.

A: Alternatively can use DiffRN-Traj.

### P. Weng
Q: Formalize the anomaly detection rules. compute examples etc for the monday presentation.

A: I will present the rules (and examples if all goes well).
