## **1\. Executive Summary**

The domain of urban mobility is increasingly reliant on vast datasets of taxi trajectories for critical applications such as traffic management, urban planning, and fraud detection. However, the inherent scarcity of anomalous events, coupled with significant privacy concerns and the high cost of data annotation, presents substantial challenges for traditional data-driven approaches. This report delves into the cutting-edge advancements in unsupervised and weakly supervised generation of anomalous synthetic taxi trajectories, a field poised to revolutionize how these challenges are addressed.  
The strategic importance of synthetic data lies in its ability to overcome real-world data limitations by providing scalable, diverse, and privacy-preserving alternatives to naturally collected information.1 This report introduces the leading generative model paradigms—Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models—highlighting their specific architectural adaptations and training objectives tailored for complex spatio-temporal data. Furthermore, it details various techniques for programmatically injecting diverse anomalous behaviors into these synthetic trajectories, moving beyond simple statistical outliers to capture nuanced, real-world deviations. The ability to precisely define and generate these anomalous patterns is crucial for developing robust anomaly detection systems, enabling more effective monitoring of urban traffic events and fraudulent activities. The discussion also addresses the current challenges, such as model complexity, training stability, and ensuring generalizability, while outlining promising future research directions to advance this critical area.

## **2\. Introduction to Anomalous Taxi Trajectories and Synthetic Data**

### **Defining Anomalies in Taxi Trajectories: Characteristics and Types**

Anomalous taxi trajectories are not merely statistical outliers but are defined as deviations from typical or regular driving patterns, frequently representing the minority choices of drivers that diverge significantly from the regular selections made by the majority.3 These deviations often signify specific underlying behaviors, such as intentional misconduct, or unexpected external events that impact urban traffic flow.3 Understanding the nuanced nature of these anomalies is paramount for developing effective detection and mitigation strategies.  
Anomalies can be broadly categorized into two primary types based on their underlying cause:

* **Subjective Anomalies:** These anomalies originate from intentional decisions made by drivers. A prominent example involves drivers deliberately taking unnecessary detours to overcharge passengers, a common form of taxi driving fraud.4 Such choices might also be influenced by accommodating specific passenger requests that deviate from the most efficient route.3 The defining characteristic of subjective anomalies is typically a significant increase in the overall length of the trajectory, as the driver intentionally extends the travel path.3 The challenge in detecting these lies in the cunning nature of experienced drivers who may manipulate routes subtly to avoid detection.4  
* **Objective Anomalies:** In contrast, objective anomalies are triggered by unforeseen external factors within the urban environment. These include adverse traffic events such as accidents, severe road congestion, or road closures.3 While the route length might remain consistent with a typical path, these events lead to a notable increase in the time required to complete the trajectory.3 Analyzing these anomalies offers an opportunity to monitor and respond to dynamic urban traffic conditions effectively.3

Beyond this binary classification, anomalous behavior can be further refined into four distinct patterns, derived from statistical indicators of trajectory length and time 3:

* **Anomalous behavior pattern 1 (Abp1):** This pattern occurs when both the length and time of a trajectory are less than or equal to the average length and time of normal trajectories, plus a defined threshold. This could indicate an unusually efficient route, perhaps a shortcut known to only a few drivers, or an exceptionally smooth traffic flow.  
* **Anomalous behavior pattern 2 (Abp2):** Characterized by a trajectory length within normal bounds, but a time significantly exceeding the normal average plus a threshold. This pattern strongly suggests the presence of adverse traffic events, such as unexpected congestion or a temporary blockage along the route, causing substantial delays without a major change in distance.3  
* **Anomalous behavior pattern 3 (Abp3):** In this scenario, the trajectory length is greater than the normal average plus a threshold, indicating a detour, but the time taken remains less than or equal to the normal average plus a threshold. This could imply that a driver intentionally chose a longer route to circumvent anticipated traffic or road conditions, ultimately maintaining a reasonable travel time. It might also reflect a driver unfamiliar with the most optimal route who, despite taking a longer path, manages to complete the trip efficiently.3  
* **Anomalous behavior pattern 4 (Abp4):** This pattern is defined by both the length and time of the trajectory significantly exceeding their respective normal averages plus a threshold. This combination is a strong indicator of fraudulent driving routes, where the primary motivation is to overcharge customers by extending both the distance and duration of the trip.3

The manifestation of anomalies extends beyond mere length and time. They can also appear as unusual speed changes, significant deviations from typical routes, unexpected directions, or sudden, uncharacteristic turns or stops.5 It is important to recognize that subtle local detours may not drastically alter the overall distance of a trip, making them particularly challenging to detect using only simple distance-based methods.4 Therefore, a comprehensive approach to anomaly definition, which moves beyond a simple statistical outlier perspective to incorporate the subjective (intentional) and objective (environmental) causes, is critical for extracting actionable intelligence from taxi trajectory data. This nuanced understanding allows for more targeted detection of specific types of anomalies, leading to more effective interventions in urban mobility management and fraud detection.

## **3\. Motivations and Benefits of Generating Anomalous Synthetic Taxi Trajectories**

The generation of synthetic anomalous taxi trajectories offers substantial advantages in overcoming critical limitations inherent in real-world data, thereby enhancing the development and evaluation of intelligent transportation systems.

### **Addressing Data Scarcity and Imbalance**

Anomalies, by their very definition, are rare and unpredictable events.1 This inherent rarity makes the collection of sufficient real-world anomalous samples for robust model training and evaluation exceptionally difficult and resource-intensive.1 The consequence is a significant data imbalance, where normal samples vastly outnumber anomalous ones, leading to models that may struggle to accurately identify infrequent but critical events.1  
Synthetic data directly addresses these challenges by enabling the controlled generation of both normal and anomalous samples, tailored to specific applications.1 This capability allows for the creation of diverse and scalable datasets that would be impractical or impossible to acquire naturally.1 Furthermore, real-world mobility data, especially GPS trajectories, often contains sensitive personal information, such as an individual's movement patterns, personal profiles, geographical locations, and social contacts.9 Releasing or even using such data raises significant privacy concerns and necessitates strict safeguards.2 Synthetic data generation provides a powerful privacy-preserving alternative, as it mimics the statistical properties of real datasets without disclosing actual individual data points, thereby simplifying compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.2

### **Enhancing Model Training and Evaluation**

The ability to generate synthetic anomalous trajectories dramatically improves the training and evaluation of anomaly detection models. These synthetic datasets can be used to build labeled datasets, enabling the training, validation, and benchmarking of anomaly detection models in a controlled and repeatable setting.17 This is particularly valuable for addressing the limitations of traditional anomaly detection methods, which often rely on rigid assumptions about data distribution or struggle with the high dimensionality and non-linearity characteristic of spatio-temporal data.18  
Data augmentation with synthetic anomalies can significantly improve model robustness, allowing models to learn from a wider range of anomalous scenarios than real data alone could provide.1 This is crucial because anomalies are highly diverse, making comprehensive coverage through real-world collection difficult.1 Synthetic data allows for the simulation of rare or dangerous edge cases, such as specific types of road accidents for autonomous vehicles or complex cybersecurity breaches, which are difficult or unethical to collect in real-world settings.16 The consistent generation of benchmark datasets with systematically varied problem dimensions—such as point difficulty, relative frequency of anomalies, and clusteredness—is essential for gaining a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various anomaly detection algorithms and preventing overfitting.20

### **Facilitating Urban Planning and Traffic Management**

The generation and analysis of anomalous synthetic taxi trajectories have profound implications for urban planning and traffic management. These trajectories provide opportunities to extract insights into driver and passenger behaviors and to monitor adverse urban traffic events.3 The ability to simulate various types of traffic anomalies, such as data switching, data shifting, missing data, and irregular curves, helps transportation agencies understand and correct for data inconsistencies that might otherwise lead to misinterpretations of traffic conditions and inefficient resource allocation.22  
Beyond detection, the insights gained from analyzing these synthetic anomalies are highly valuable for relevant agencies and organizations. They enable better-informed decision-making, allowing for necessary arrangements and proactive actions to provide solutions for urban traffic challenges.18 For instance, synthetic trajectories can facilitate detailed analysis of aircraft behavior during critical flight phases or help delivery companies monitor trucks for deviations that could cause delays.6 More broadly, this technology supports optimizing public transportation systems, identifying congestion points, and enhancing urban infrastructure planning.12 The capacity to generate specific anomalous patterns allows for targeted improvements in urban systems, leading to more efficient and safer transportation networks.

## **4\. Generative Models for Synthetic Trajectory Generation**

The development of realistic and diverse synthetic taxi trajectories, especially anomalous ones, heavily relies on advanced generative models. These models operate under various learning paradigms, each offering distinct advantages for handling the complexities of spatio-temporal data.

### **Unsupervised and Weakly Supervised Learning Paradigms**

**Unsupervised representation learning** aims to extract discriminative feature representations from unlabeled data, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotation.23 This paradigm is particularly crucial for time series data, such as taxi trajectories, due to the unique annotation bottleneck caused by their complex characteristics and lack of visual cues compared to other data modalities.23 In this context, unsupervised methods learn the underlying data distribution to generate new, similar samples.25  
**Weakly supervised learning**, often considered a form of semi-supervised learning, addresses the challenge of limited labeled data by combining a small amount of human-annotated data with a large volume of unlabeled or imprecisely labeled data.26 This approach is highly relevant for scenarios where obtaining perfectly labeled anomalous trajectories is difficult and costly. Instead of relying solely on fully supervised annotations, weakly supervised methods can leverage intrinsic properties of the data to autonomously generate labels through "pretext tasks," a concept central to  
**self-supervised learning**.24 For instance, self-supervised learning methods can induce supervision by designing tasks like predicting future data points or reconstructing masked inputs.24  
The fusion of generative models with weak supervision holds substantial promise, primarily by significantly reducing data acquisition costs for training complex models.29 This is achieved by using weak sources of training signals, such as programmatic labeling functions applied to unlabeled data, to produce "pseudolabels" that can then train downstream supervised models.29 This approach allows generative models to capture discrete latent variables in the data alongside the weak supervision-derived label estimates, potentially leading to better disentangled latent variables and improved generative performance.29 This synergy enables the creation of large, diverse synthetic datasets that are crucial for training robust anomaly detection systems, especially when real-world anomalous data is scarce.

### **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a prominent class of machine learning frameworks for generative AI, renowned for their ability to produce realistic data that mimics the statistics of a training set.30  
**Core Architecture and Principles:** A GAN system comprises two deep neural networks: a **generator (G)** and a **discriminator (D)**. These two networks are trained in an adversarial, zero-sum game.30 The generator takes random noise as input and transforms it into synthetic data, attempting to make it indistinguishable from real data. Simultaneously, the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real data from a given training dataset and the fake data produced by the generator. The discriminator provides a signal to the generator, penalizing implausible results and guiding the generator to improve its output.30 This adversarial process continues until a Nash equilibrium is ideally reached, where the generator produces highly realistic data, and the discriminator can no longer reliably differentiate between real and synthetic samples.30  
**Adaptations for Spatio-temporal Trajectories:** Applying GANs to spatio-temporal data, such as taxi trajectories, presents unique challenges because this data is often continuous in space and time, exhibiting complex spatial and temporal correlations that are difficult for traditional techniques to capture.33 Standard image or video generation GANs are not directly applicable due to the distinct nature of trajectory data.33 To address this, several adaptations have emerged:

* **RNN-based Sequence GANs:** For generating discrete location sequences, models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are integrated into GANs. These approaches often leverage reinforcement learning (e.g., policy gradients) and Monte Carlo search to generate sequences that preserve spatio-temporal statistics.35  
* **CNN-based GANs with Transformations (RTCT):** A novel approach involves transforming trajectories into an image-like format to leverage the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image generation. The Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) adapts location trajectories into a matrix format (e.g., 12x12, upscaled to 24x24x4) suitable for Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs).9 This method shows promise in capturing spatial distributions but may struggle with replicating sequential and temporal properties.9  
* **Multi-task Generators (STAGE GAN):** To generate synthetic trajectories that statistically resemble real data across different spatial scales, multi-task generators have been developed. For instance, the STAGE (Spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced multi-TAsk GEnerative adversarial network) GAN employs a three-stage generation process: activity-sequence generation, township-level trajectory generation, and neighborhood-level trajectory generation. It incorporates a spatial consistency loss during adversarial training to ensure consistency across scales.38  
* **Bidirectional GANs (BiGAN) with Gaussian Mixture Models (IGMM-GAN):** To address the challenge of multimodal patterns in mobility data, models like IGMM-GAN (Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model coupled with BiGAN) are used. This architecture learns an encoder in addition to the generator and discriminator, mapping trajectory data into a latent space where anomalies can be detected using Mahalanobis distance-based scoring.39 This approach simultaneously generates realistic data and facilitates multimodal anomaly detection.

**Loss Functions and Training Objectives:** The primary training objective for GANs is the adversarial loss, formulated as a minimax game where the generator aims to minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish real from fake, and the discriminator aims to maximize its accuracy.30 Specific adaptations include the spatial consistency loss in STAGE GAN to enforce spatial coherence across generated trajectories.38 For anomaly detection, GANs often leverage reconstruction error, where the model learns to generate only normal data, and deviations from this learned normal manifold are flagged as anomalies.41  
The evolution of GAN architectures for spatio-temporal data reflects a continuous effort to balance generating high-quality, realistic outputs with maintaining training stability and capturing complex data correlations. While early GANs suffered from unstable training and mode collapse 8, advancements like DCGANs introduced architectural guidelines to improve stability and quality.36 The trade-offs often involve balancing fidelity (how realistic the data is) with diversity (the variety of generated samples) and the computational burden.

### **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are another powerful class of generative models that learn a latent representation of data and can generate new samples that are similar to the original data distribution.24 Unlike GANs, VAEs explicitly model the data distribution, which can lead to more stable training processes.44  
**Core Architecture and Principles:** A VAE consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps input data to a latent space, typically a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution, defined by its mean and variance. The decoder then samples from this latent distribution to reconstruct the input data. The training objective for VAEs typically involves minimizing a loss function that combines a reconstruction error (ensuring the generated data is similar to the input) and a regularization term (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence) that encourages the latent distribution to be close to a prior distribution (e.g., a standard normal distribution).47 This regularization promotes a well-structured and continuous latent space, which is beneficial for generating diverse samples and interpolating between existing data points.  
**Adaptations for Spatio-temporal Trajectories:** For spatio-temporal trajectory generation, VAEs have been adapted to capture the sequential and dynamic nature of the data:

* **LSTM-based VAEs (TrajVAE):** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are frequently integrated into VAE architectures to effectively model the temporal dependencies and characteristics of trajectories. Models like TrajVAE leverage LSTMs within the VAE framework to generate realistic trajectories by learning their sequential properties.44  
* **Time-Based VQ-VAE:** For specialized applications like aircraft trajectory generation, more sophisticated VAE variants such as Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (TimeVQVAE) have been developed.48 This architecture employs time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization for data compression into a discrete latent space, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, TimeVQVAE learns long-range spatio-temporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths, producing synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties.48  
* **Semi-supervised VAEs (SSVAE):** To enhance the generation and classification of multi-agent trajectories, semi-supervised VAEs (SSVAEs) are employed. These models incorporate partially observed discrete labels to guide the generative process.50 They utilize customized graph networks to capture the equivariance and interaction of agents, allowing for the disentanglement of discrete and continuous latent effects. This provides a natural solution for injecting valuable domain knowledge into interactive sequential systems, leading to improved performance in both generation and classification tasks on real-world data.50

**Loss Functions and Training Objectives:** VAEs are trained by maximizing a variational lower bound on the likelihood of the data, often referred to as the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This objective combines the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence term, balancing data fidelity with latent space regularization. For SSVAEs, the training objective is extended to incorporate the available labels, maximizing a combined lower bound on both labeled and unlabeled data, and heuristically incorporating label-dependent objectives to learn the mapping from data to labels.50 The strength of VAEs lies in their stable training and the interpretability of their latent spaces, which can be leveraged to understand and control the characteristics of generated trajectories.

### **Diffusion Models**

Diffusion Models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality and diverse samples across various domains, including time series and spatio-temporal data.1 They are particularly noted for their training stability compared to GANs.1  
**Core Architecture and Principles:** Diffusion models operate through two interconnected processes: a predefined **forward diffusion process** and a learned **reverse (denoising) process**.51

1. **Forward Process (Noising):** This process gradually introduces noise (typically Gaussian) to the original data (x0​) over a series of T time steps, transforming it into a latent variable (xT​) that follows a known noise distribution (e.g., Gaussian noise).51  
2. **Reverse (Denoising) Process:** This is the generative part of the model. A neural network is trained to learn the reverse of the forward process, gradually denoising the random noise (xT​) back to reconstruct the original data (x0​).51 This step-by-step reconstruction from random noise makes diffusion models highly flexible and capable of generating diverse and realistic samples.1

**Adaptations for Spatio-temporal Trajectories:** The complex spatio-temporal nature of trajectory data requires specialized adaptations for diffusion models:

* **DiffTraj:** This framework proposes a spatial-temporal diffusion probabilistic model specifically for GPS trajectory generation. It reconstructs and synthesizes geographic trajectories from white noise through a reverse trajectory denoising process. A key component is the **Traj-UNet** deep neural network, which is based on the UNet architecture and composed of 1D-CNN-based stacked residual network blocks for down-sampling and up-sampling. An attention mechanism-based transitional module is integrated between these parts. DiffTraj also incorporates time step embedding using Sinusoidal embedding and a **Wide & Deep network** to embed conditional information (numerical motion properties like velocity, distance, and discrete external properties like departure time, regions).60 To ensure diversity and prevent overly deterministic patterns, DiffTraj employs a  
  **classifier-free diffusion guidance method**, jointly training conditional and unconditional models.63 It also adopts a  
  **non-Markov diffusion process approach** with a skip-step method to significantly speed up the typically slow reverse diffusion process.63  
* **ControlTraj:** This framework focuses on controllable trajectory generation with topology constraints. It integrates the structural constraints of road network topology to guide geographical outcomes. ControlTraj utilizes a novel **Masked Road Autoencoder (RoadMAE)** to extract fine-grained road segment embeddings, which are then merged with trip attributes into a **GeoUNet** (geographic attention-based UNet architecture). GeoUNet integrates geo-attention mechanisms (self-attention and cross-attention) to fuse multi-scale features and incorporate external conditional information. This enables the generation of human-directed, high-fidelity trajectories with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.64  
* **Diff-RNTraj:** This model addresses the problem of road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, directly generating trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid data type (discrete road segment, continuous moving rate). Diff-RNTraj handles this hybrid data using a continuous diffusion framework, incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. A **RNTraj decoder** maps the continuous representation back to the hybrid format during sampling. It also introduces a novel loss function to enhance trajectory's spatial validity.61  
* **AutoSTDiff:** This represents an autoregressive spatio-temporal denoising diffusion model designed for asynchronous trajectory generation.66

**Loss Functions and Training Objectives:** The core training objective for diffusion models is to minimize the mean squared error between the Gaussian noise added during the forward process and the noise predicted by the neural network during the reverse process.63 For models like ControlTraj, an additional  
**RoadMAE reconstruction loss** is used to optimize the effectiveness of the masked road autoencoder in capturing road segment topology.64 Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function specifically designed to enhance the spatial validity of generated trajectories.61  
The advantages of diffusion models include their capacity to produce high-quality and diverse samples, their inherent privacy preservation due to generating from random noise rather than replicating specific data points, and their ability to perform controllable generation through guided sampling without additional training costs.1 However, a key consideration is their computational intensity, particularly the time-intensive sampling process during the reverse diffusion, which often requires many function evaluations.14 Research efforts are ongoing to mitigate this, including non-Markov diffusion processes for faster sampling.63

## **5\. Techniques for Injecting Anomalies into Synthetic Trajectories**

The utility of synthetic taxi trajectories for anomaly detection hinges on the ability to inject diverse and realistic anomalous patterns. This process can broadly be categorized into rule-based and learning-based perturbation methods.

### **Rule-Based Perturbation Methods**

Rule-based synthetic data generation relies on predefined logic, constraints, and deterministic patterns to create test data.15 These rules are typically derived from domain knowledge or heuristics, which are expert-defined guidelines based on common sense or field expertise, used to flag deviations from expected patterns.72  
The primary advantages of rule-based methods include full control over the generated data, ensuring consistency across datasets, and facilitating compliance with specific requirements or regulations.70 This approach is ideal for generating specific edge cases or scenarios where anomalies are well-understood and can be explicitly defined.70 For instance, one can programmatically inject specific behavioral anomalies into trajectories by altering normal paths based on predefined rules. This could involve:

* **Route deviations:** Introducing detours that increase travel distance or lead to unexpected locations.4  
* **Abnormal stops:** Inserting unscheduled or prolonged stops along a route.  
* **Speed changes:** Modifying speed profiles to include sudden accelerations, decelerations, or sustained periods of unusually high or low speed.5  
* **Sudden turns:** Injecting sharp, uncharacteristic turns not aligned with typical road geometry.  
* **Loitering or zig-zagging:** Creating patterns of aimless or erratic movement, often indicative of fraudulent activity or unusual behavior.4

Despite their advantages, rule-based methods have limitations. They can require significant manual effort to define complex constraints and may not fully capture the intricate statistical complexity of real-world data as effectively as model-based approaches.70 A critical drawback is their static nature, which makes them susceptible to being circumvented by novel or evolving anomalous behaviors. These systems often detect events only after they have occurred, limiting their ability to anticipate and prevent malicious or risky activities.74 For example, rule-based anomaly labeling has been used to define specific scenarios like tailgating or sudden braking for evaluating model performance.75

### **Learning-Based Perturbation Methods**

Learning-based perturbation methods leverage advanced machine learning models to generate and inject anomalies, offering greater flexibility and realism than purely rule-based approaches.  
One prominent technique involves using generative models, particularly diffusion models, to synthesize anomalous data. This is achieved by training a diffusion model on normal, in-distribution data. During the synthesis step, this trained model can then "edit" a given input image or trajectory to remove anomalous segments while keeping the remaining parts unchanged. Anomaly detection is then framed as analyzing which segments of the input were modified by the diffusion model, as these modifications highlight the anomalous regions.54 This approach allows for the generation of diverse and realistic anomalies without explicit rule-sets.  
Another method involves learning small, minimal perturbations to normal data to create "abnormal" data samples for training a classifier.77 This process jointly trains a "perturbator" and a classifier using deep neural networks. The perturbator is designed to apply the smallest possible modifications to normal data points such that the classifier can still distinguish them as abnormal, effectively defining a decision boundary between normal and abnormal data even when no true anomalous samples are available during training.77 This technique helps in generating synthetic anomalies that are "close" to normal data but sufficiently deviant to be recognized as anomalous.  
For benchmarking and controlled experimentation, localized spikes can be programmatically injected into time series data. This allows for the creation of labeled datasets where the exact location and size of the anomaly are known, facilitating the training, validation, and performance evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms.17 Furthermore, advanced techniques can perturb specific features, such as optical flow in video data, using methods like mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions, thereby generating pseudo-anomalies that reflect realistic deviations.79  
A significant development in this area is the rise of **physics-informed diffusion models**. These models integrate kinematic constraints and prior physical knowledge into the generation process. This ensures that the generated anomalous trajectories not only deviate from normal patterns but also adhere to or violate physical laws in a plausible manner. This capability is crucial for identifying physically infeasible behaviors, such as sudden, impossible changes in speed or direction, which are often indicative of GPS spoofing or sensor errors.56 The ability of learning-based methods to generate diverse and realistic anomalies without explicit rules, coupled with their capacity to integrate physical constraints, significantly improves the robustness and practical applicability of anomaly detection systems.

## **6\. Evaluation Metrics for Synthetic Trajectories and Anomaly Detection**

Evaluating the quality of synthetic trajectories and the performance of anomaly detection algorithms is crucial for ensuring their practical utility. This involves a multi-faceted approach using both generative and discriminative metrics.

### **Realism and Diversity Metrics for Synthetic Trajectories**

The quality of synthetic trajectories is assessed based on their realism, diversity, and overall usefulness.8 Realism refers to how closely the synthetic data mimics the statistical properties and patterns of real-world data, while diversity measures the variety of generated samples.  
Metrics for evaluating these aspects include:

* **Lexical Diversity Metrics:** Adapted from natural language processing, these metrics capture surface-level repetition. Examples include:  
  * **Distinct n-grams (Distinct-k):** The ratio of unique n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the generated dataset.80  
  * **N-gram Entropy:** Measures the uniformity of the probability distribution over n-grams, with higher entropy indicating greater diversity.80  
  * **Compression Ratio:** A higher compression ratio indicates greater redundancy and thus lower diversity in the generated data.80  
* **Semantic Diversity Metrics:** These metrics assess the deeper, conceptual variety within the generated data, including Embedding Diversity, DCScore, and Cluster Inertia.80  
* **Spatial-Temporal Distribution Metrics:** These evaluate how well the synthetic trajectories capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of real data:  
  * **Density error:** Measures the geo-distribution similarity between entire generated trajectories and real ones.60  
  * **Trip error:** Quantifies differences in the distribution of trip origins and endpoints.60  
  * **Length error:** Focuses on discrepancies between real and synthetic trajectory lengths.60  
  * **Pattern score:** Calculates the similarity of overall movement patterns.60  
  * **Hausdorff Distance (HD) and Sliced Wasserstein Distance (WD):** These are used to compare the spatial distributions of generated and real trajectories.14  
  * **Total Travelled Distance (TTD) and Time Reversal Ratio (TRR):** Additional metrics for evaluating the fidelity of generated trajectories.14  
  * **Jensen-Shannon Divergence:** Measures the similarity between the probability distributions of generated and real trajectory movements.45

A multi-faceted evaluation approach, incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments (e.g., visual inspection), is essential to ensure that synthetic data is not only statistically similar but also truly representative and useful for downstream tasks.

### **Performance Metrics for Anomaly Detection**

Evaluating the performance of spatio-temporal anomaly detection algorithms requires a set of robust metrics that account for the inherent class imbalance (anomalies being rare).  
Standard metrics commonly employed include:

* **Precision:** Measures the proportion of correctly identified anomalies out of all detected cases (True Positives / (True Positives \+ False Positives)). It quantifies the rate of false alarms.83  
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** Calculates the fraction of true anomalies that were successfully detected (True Positives / (True Positives \+ False Negatives)). It highlights the ability to find all relevant anomalies, minimizing missed cases.83  
* **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. This is particularly useful when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets, as it penalizes models that achieve high precision at the expense of low recall, or vice versa.83  
* **Area Under the Curve (AUC) Measures:**  
  * **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve):** Plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate across various classification thresholds. It provides an aggregate view of performance across all possible thresholds.83  
  * **PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve):** Focuses on the trade-off between precision and recall. It is often more informative than ROC-AUC for highly imbalanced datasets where anomalies are rare, as it emphasizes the performance on the minority class.83

In addition to these general metrics, domain-specific measures are crucial for practical applications:

* **False Positive Rate (FPR):** Critical in applications where false alarms can be costly or disruptive (e.g., incorrectly flagging healthy patients in medical diagnostics, or halting production in industrial settings).83  
* **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD):** Measures how quickly anomalies are identified in time-series data, which is vital for real-time monitoring systems where timely intervention can minimize impact (e.g., cybersecurity systems prioritizing quick detection to reduce breach impact).83  
* **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):** Provides a balanced measure for binary classification, especially valuable when class distributions are skewed, as it accounts for all four values in the confusion matrix (True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives).83  
* **Perplexity and Surprisal Rate:** For anomaly detection methods that leverage language models or probabilistic approaches, perplexity can be used to identify outlier trajectories by measuring the uncertainty in predicting the next location. A high perplexity or surprisal rate indicates a low-probability event, signaling an anomaly.85

The selection of appropriate metrics depends heavily on the specific use case and the relative costs of false positives versus false negatives. For instance, in fraud detection, high recall might be prioritized to catch most fraudulent transactions, while in quality control, minimizing false positives (high precision) might be more critical to avoid unnecessary production halts.83

## **7\. Publicly Available Taxi Trajectory Datasets for Benchmarking**

The availability of robust and representative datasets is fundamental for advancing research in unsupervised and weakly supervised generation of anomalous synthetic taxi trajectories. Several publicly available datasets serve as crucial benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics that influence their suitability for various research objectives.

### **Key Datasets and Their Characteristics**

* **T-Drive Dataset:** This widely recognized dataset comprises one-week trajectories of 10,357 taxis in Beijing, accumulating approximately 15 million GPS points and a total distance of 9 million kilometers.10 While extensive, this dataset contains unique trajectories that pose a risk of location disclosure if an attacker identifies any part of the trajectory, highlighting significant privacy concerns associated with real-world mobility data.11  
* **Porto Taxi Dataset:** This dataset provides detailed taxi trip information, including features such as TRIP\_ID, CALL\_TYPE (dispatch, stand, or random street), ORIGIN\_CALL, ORIGIN\_STAND, TAXI\_ID, TIMESTAMP, DAYTYPE, MISSING\_DATA (boolean), and POLYLINE (a list of GPS coordinates at 15-second intervals).87 The  
  POLYLINE field is particularly valuable as it contains the full trajectory of each trip. This dataset has been utilized in research for detecting user-contextual anomalies, demonstrating its utility for fine-grained behavioral analysis.85  
* **GeoLife Dataset:** The GeoLife dataset captures the movements of 182 individuals in Beijing over more than five years.88 However, it is noted for its sparsity, with only 45 users having more than 100 "staypoints," meaning patterns primarily focus on a small subset of active users.88 To address this, "GeoLife+" datasets have been created through simulation, aiming to generate human movements that closely adhere to the statistical features of the original GeoLife data, such as Average Distance per Trip (ADT), Average Distance per Agent per Day (ADA), Maximum Trip Distance (MXD), and Median Trip Distance (MDD).88 These simulated datasets significantly increase data volume, density, and continuity, making them more suitable for large-scale analysis while preserving privacy.88  
* **NYC Taxi Dataset:** This dataset provides hourly traffic data for 2015 and has been used for various spatio-temporal data mining tasks, including motif discovery, anomaly detection, and segmentation.91 It is also available as part of the Numenta anomaly benchmark.92 A processed version consists of 1,000 taxi trajectories over a one-year period, represented as sequences of visited neighborhoods in Manhattan, with transitions corresponding to pickups and dropoffs.93 Similar to the T-Drive dataset, the NYC taxi dataset is known for privacy concerns, as celebrity travel routes were reportedly identified from it.13  
* **Foursquare NYC Dataset:** This dataset, often used in conjunction with GeoLife, is available in pre-processed forms for research on GAN-based trajectory generation, such as in the CNN-TRAJGAN repository.94 It focuses on check-in data, which can be converted into trajectories.

The exploration of these datasets highlights a critical trade-off: real-world datasets offer authentic patterns but are often limited in scale, suffer from quality issues, and pose significant privacy risks. Conversely, synthetic datasets, while requiring careful validation to ensure realism and utility, can overcome these limitations by providing scalable, privacy-preserving alternatives tailored for specific research and application needs. The continued development of synthetic data generation techniques and the availability of diverse benchmark datasets are crucial for advancing the field of anomalous taxi trajectory analysis.

## **8\. Challenges and Future Directions**

The field of unsupervised and weakly supervised generation of anomalous synthetic taxi trajectories, while promising, faces several complex challenges that necessitate ongoing research and innovative solutions.

### **Defining and Characterizing Anomalies**

A fundamental challenge lies in uniformly defining what constitutes an "abnormality" in trajectory data. This definition is inherently subjective and context-dependent, relying heavily on various similarity measures.19 Distinguishing between harmless noise or natural variations in data and truly malicious intentions or critical events is a non-trivial task.7 For instance, a longer route could be due to traffic (objective anomaly) or intentional overcharging (subjective anomaly), requiring sophisticated analysis to differentiate. Future research needs to focus on developing more adaptive and context-aware anomaly definitions that can dynamically adjust to changing urban environments and driver behaviors.

### **Data Scarcity and Quality**

As previously discussed, real-world anomalies are rare and unpredictable, making their collection resource-intensive and leading to significant data imbalance in real datasets.1 Furthermore, real-world trajectory data often suffers from inconsistencies, missing values, and irregular sampling rates, which can hinder the effectiveness of generative models.22 For example, Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) data can exhibit issues like data switching, data shifting, and irregular curves, which can lead to misinterpretations of traffic conditions.22 Addressing these data quality issues, perhaps through advanced data imputation techniques integrated into generative pipelines, remains a critical area.

### **Model Complexity and Training Stability**

Deep generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion Models, are computationally demanding, requiring substantial computational resources and time for training, especially for large-scale spatio-temporal data.14 GANs, in particular, are notorious for their training instability and susceptibility to mode collapse, where the generator produces a limited variety of samples.8 While Diffusion Models offer greater stability, their iterative sampling process can be time-intensive, posing challenges for real-time applications.57 Future work should explore more efficient architectures and training strategies to address these computational burdens.

### **Generalizability and Transferability**

A significant hurdle is ensuring that synthetic data accurately reflects the complex spatial-temporal patterns and statistical properties of real-world data, and that models trained on synthetic data generalize well to unseen real-world scenarios.38 The ability to transfer models trained on data from one city to another, without extensive retraining, is also critical for broader applicability.65 Research into domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques for synthetic trajectory generation will be vital.

### **Privacy Preservation**

While synthetic data offers a promising solution for privacy concerns, ensuring that generated data truly omits sensitive information and prevents reverse engineering of real trajectories remains an ongoing challenge.2 Balancing data utility with stringent privacy protection is a complex optimization problem that requires continuous innovation in privacy-preserving generative models.

### **Programmatic Control and Specificity**

A key area for advancement is the ability to programmatically inject diverse and realistic behavioral anomalies with fine-grained control. Current methods, whether rule-based or learning-based, still face limitations in precisely simulating complex anomalous behaviors such as loitering, zig-zagging, or subtle detours that do not significantly alter overall distance.4 Integrating physical kinematic constraints into generative models, as seen in physics-informed diffusion models, is a promising direction to ensure that generated anomalies are not only statistically unusual but also physically plausible or impossible, thereby enhancing their utility for detecting real-world fraudulent or erroneous activities.56  
Future research will likely focus on hybrid models that combine the strengths of different generative paradigms, more sophisticated conditional generation mechanisms, and robust evaluation frameworks that can precisely quantify the realism and utility of synthetic anomalous trajectories for a wide array of downstream applications.

## **9\. Conclusions**

The research area of unsupervised and weakly supervised generation of anomalous synthetic taxi trajectories represents a critical frontier in urban mobility and data science. The inherent challenges posed by data scarcity, class imbalance, and privacy concerns in real-world taxi trajectory data underscore the transformative potential of synthetic data. By moving beyond simplistic definitions of anomalies to encompass subjective (intentional) and objective (environmental) causes, researchers can develop more targeted and actionable intelligence for urban management and fraud detection.  
Generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable progress in synthesizing complex spatio-temporal data. Each paradigm offers unique architectural adaptations and training objectives to capture the intricate dynamics of taxi trajectories. GANs, with their adversarial training, strive for high realism, while VAEs offer stable training and interpretable latent spaces. Diffusion Models stand out for their ability to generate high-quality, diverse samples and their inherent privacy-preserving properties, despite their computational intensity. The continuous evolution of these models, incorporating techniques like CNN-based transformations, multi-task learning, and physics-informed constraints, is steadily enhancing their capacity to produce increasingly realistic and controllable anomalous trajectories.  
The ability to programmatically inject specific behavioral anomalies, whether through rule-based perturbations or sophisticated learning-based methods, is fundamental for creating comprehensive benchmark datasets. These synthetic datasets are indispensable for rigorously training and evaluating anomaly detection systems, especially where real anomalous data is sparse or sensitive. The adoption of multi-faceted evaluation metrics, encompassing both generative quality (realism, diversity) and discriminative performance (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC), is essential to validate the utility and reliability of these synthetic datasets.  
Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in refining anomaly definitions, managing model complexity, ensuring generalizability across diverse geographical contexts, and balancing privacy with data utility. Future research will likely converge on hybrid generative architectures, advanced conditioning mechanisms, and novel evaluation methodologies to address these complexities. The continued interdisciplinary efforts in this field promise to unlock new capabilities for understanding, managing, and securing urban transportation systems, ultimately leading to safer, more efficient, and more equitable cities.
