# **A Comprehensive Methodology for Generating and Detecting Anomalous Taxi Trajectories using Diffusion Models**

## **1\. Introduction to Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Data and Synthetic Generation**

The analysis of spatio-temporal trajectory data has become increasingly vital for understanding complex urban dynamics and enhancing various smart city applications. These datasets, typically defined as sequences of continuously sampled GPS location points, including latitude, longitude, and time, are generated in immense volumes by ubiquitous sensors such as those found in taxis.1 Such data provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing the movements of objects, uncovering fundamental behavioral patterns, and gaining profound insights into urban traffic systems.2 Key applications derived from this rich data include sophisticated traffic flow analysis, precise route choice modeling, accurate travel time estimation, and the timely detection of adverse urban traffic events, all of which contribute to more efficient and safer urban environments.3  
The increasing volume and analytical potential of spatio-temporal data, particularly GPS trajectories, are inherently linked with growing privacy concerns and the persistent challenge of scarce labeled anomalous events. This confluence creates a compelling demand for synthetic data generation methods that are not only realistic and diverse but also inherently privacy-preserving. A significant challenge in anomaly detection (AD) across various domains, including spatio-temporal data, is the inherent rarity and lack of labeled anomalous instances.6 This scarcity severely hinders the effective training of robust deep supervised models for AD. Synthetic data generation directly addresses this by enabling the controlled creation of diverse and scalable datasets containing both normal and anomalous samples.7  
Concurrently, GPS trajectories inherently contain sensitive personal geolocation information.1 The direct collection, storage, or publication of such data raises serious privacy issues, including the potential for re-identification and inference of sensitive personal details such as home or workplace locations.1 Generating synthetic trajectories offers a promising solution by replacing original sensitive data with privacy-preserving alternatives.1 The ability to reliably generate anomalous data directly translates to more effective training of anomaly detection models. If this generated data also adheres to privacy principles, it removes a major ethical and regulatory barrier to deployment. This has direct, positive ripple effects on smart city initiatives 10, improving taxi driver supervision, and overall traffic management.3 The broader implication is a shift towards safer, more efficient, and privacy-conscious urban systems, enabled by synthetic data.  
Diffusion Models (DMs) represent a powerful class of probabilistic generative models well-suited to address these challenges. Their core mechanism involves a two-step process: a forward diffusion process that gradually introduces noise to data samples until they approximate a simple Gaussian distribution, and a reverse denoising process that reconstructs the original data from this noise.1 DMs excel at capturing complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, making them particularly well-suited for modeling the stochastic and intricate characteristics inherent in human behavior and spatio-temporal data.1 Recent advancements have led to widespread application of DMs in time series and spatio-temporal data mining, enhancing generative and inferential capabilities and extending their utility to various downstream tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation.17  
This Master's thesis aims to develop a robust methodology for the generation of *anomalous* taxi trajectories using advanced diffusion models (specifically DiffTraj or Diff-RNTraj). Subsequently, it will detail a comprehensive approach for the detection and classification of these generated anomalies. This research directly addresses the dual challenges of data scarcity for anomalous events in real-world datasets and the critical need for privacy-preserving synthetic data solutions in urban mobility analytics. This report will systematically detail the proposed methodology, covering the foundational generative models, techniques for controlled anomaly injection, state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, a multi-faceted evaluation framework, and crucial privacy considerations.

## **2\. Foundational Diffusion Models for Trajectory Synthesis**

The selection of an appropriate foundational diffusion model is paramount for effective taxi trajectory synthesis. Two prominent models, DiffTraj and Diff-RNTraj, offer distinct advantages and considerations for this task.

### **2.1 DiffTraj: A Spatial-Temporal Diffusion Probabilistic Model**

DiffTraj operates on a core mechanism that involves gradually perturbing the trajectory data distribution with noise through a "forward diffusion process".1 This process transforms complex real trajectories into a simple noise distribution. The model then learns to reverse this process, effectively "denoising" the data step-by-step from white noise to reconstruct and synthesize geographic trajectories.1 This reverse process is designed to recover the original data distribution.  
DiffTraj exhibits several notable strengths. Its iterative reconstruction of data from random noise makes it particularly well-suited for capturing the complex, stochastic, and uncertain characteristics inherent in real-world human activities and movements, thereby generating realistic GPS trajectories.1 Furthermore, experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity trajectories that accurately retain the original data distributions.10 Compared to previous methods like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or approaches relying on image transformation, DiffTraj directly explores spatial and temporal distributions without requiring additional data manipulation, which contributes to its superior quality.1 A significant advantage of DiffTraj is its inherent privacy-preserving nature. Since the model generates trajectories by stepwise denoising from random noise, it does not replicate exact real-world trajectories of individuals. Instead, it learns the general patterns and structures of the data, ensuring that generated trajectories are representative but not exact replicas. This process effectively decouples synthetic data from specific real data points, thereby eliminating the risk of privacy leakage and preventing reverse engineering of real trajectories.1  
However, there are considerations when employing DiffTraj. While innovative, the process of generating trajectories can be computationally demanding. Despite this, the developers suggest it represents a more cost-effective solution than the extensive costs associated with real-world data collection.10 Additionally, the quality and characteristics of the raw data used to train DiffTraj directly influence the synthesized trajectories. This implies that any biases or pre-existing anomalies present in the original training data might inadvertently be reflected in the synthesized data.10

### **2.2 Diff-RNTraj: Road Network-Constrained Trajectory Generation**

Diff-RNTraj is specifically designed to generate "Road Network-constrained Trajectories" (RNTraj), addressing a key limitation of many existing trajectory generation methods that operate solely in the geographical coordinate system.21 These conventional methods often fail to ensure that generated trajectories adhere to actual road networks or include crucial road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid data type, where each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate.21  
To effectively handle this hybrid data within a continuous diffusion framework, Diff-RNTraj incorporates a pre-training strategy that embeds hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations.16 During the sampling stage, a dedicated RNTraj decoder maps these continuous representations back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, the model introduces a novel loss function specifically designed to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories.16

### **2.3 Comparative Analysis: DiffTraj vs. Diff-RNTraj for Taxi Trajectories**

DiffTraj is a general-purpose spatial-temporal diffusion model that generates trajectories in the geographical coordinate system. It excels at capturing the inherent stochasticity and general patterns of movement.1 In contrast, Diff-RNTraj is specifically tailored for road network-constrained trajectories, which is highly pertinent for taxi movements that predominantly occur on defined road networks. It provides road-related information and explicitly ensures spatial validity, making its generated trajectories potentially more realistic for  
*normal* taxi operations.21  
For this thesis, the choice between or combination of these models is critical. There is a direct trade-off between the generality of a diffusion model (e.g., DiffTraj) and its domain-specific realism (e.g., Diff-RNTraj). DiffTraj offers inherent privacy and captures broad stochasticity by generating from noise.1 Diff-RNTraj, by integrating road network constraints and hybrid data types 21, is likely to produce more  
*realistic* taxi trajectories for *normal* behavior. However, this specificity might inadvertently make it *more challenging* to generate *out-of-distribution* (anomalous) data that intentionally violates these very constraints (e.g., off-road driving, physically impossible turns). This implies a crucial design decision based on the *nature* of anomalies the thesis aims to synthesize. A hybrid approach could involve training Diff-RNTraj for realistic normal data and then applying specific perturbation techniques (discussed in Section 3\) to introduce anomalies, or using DiffTraj for generating more extreme, non-road-constrained anomalies.  
The inherent privacy of diffusion models is a significant advantage. This privacy is a byproduct of their generative process (reconstructing from noise rather than replicating originals) rather than a formal, mathematically provable guarantee. This distinction is crucial for a rigorous thesis. While DMs provide a strong practical privacy baseline, they may not suffice for strict regulatory or security requirements, suggesting a need to explore formal privacy mechanisms in a later section.  
The following table provides a concise, comparative overview of the two primary diffusion models under consideration, serving as a critical decision-making tool for the thesis.  
**Table 1: Comparison of DiffTraj and Diff-RNTraj for Taxi Trajectory Generation**

| Feature | DiffTraj | Diff-RNTraj |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Model Type** | Spatial-Temporal Diffusion Probabilistic Model | Road Network-Constrained Diffusion Model |
| **Input Data Format** | Raw GPS points 1 | Hybrid (discrete road segments \+ continuous moving rate) 21 |
| **Output Data Format** | Geographic coordinates 1 | Road Network-constrained 21 |
| **Road Network Awareness** | Low/Implicit | High/Explicit 21 |
| **Anomaly Generation Suitability** | Better for broad/out-of-network anomalies | Better for road-constrained behavioral anomalies |
| **Inherent Privacy Mechanism** | Generates from noise, avoids replication 1 | Generates from noise, avoids replication 1 |
| **Computational Cost** | High 10 | High |

## **3\. Methodology for Anomalous Taxi Trajectory Generation**

Generating synthetic anomalous taxi trajectories is a critical step to address the scarcity of real-world anomalous data, which often hinders the development of robust anomaly detection systems. This section outlines a comprehensive methodology for controlled anomaly injection using diffusion models.

### **3.1 Defining Anomalies in Taxi Trajectories**

An anomaly, in the context of trajectory data, is generally defined as a data object or pattern that significantly deviates from the expected or majority behavior within a given dataset due to some unusual characteristics.2 For taxi trajectories, these deviations can be categorized as follows:

* **Spatial Anomalies:** These involve unusual geographic movements. Examples include unexpected stops in non-designated areas, significant deviations from standard or popular routes, circuitous travel (taking a much longer route than optimal for a given origin-destination pair), or even off-road driving.2 Such anomalies can often be identified by comparing a trajectory against known popular routes during specific time periods.2  
* **Temporal Anomalies:** These relate to unusual timing aspects of a trajectory. This could involve an unusually long or short duration for a given distance, or travel occurring during non-typical periods (e.g., a taxi operating in a residential area during peak sleeping hours).2  
* **Kinematic/Behavioral Anomalies:** These pertain to the physical characteristics of movement or driver behavior. Examples include abrupt changes in velocity or acceleration 23, excessive speeding, or violations of traffic direction.6 These often represent "minority choices" of drivers that deviate from the norm.3  
* **Contextual Anomalies:** A trajectory might appear normal in isolation but becomes anomalous when considered within a specific context, such as the typical movement patterns of an individual taxi driver or user.24  
* **Hybrid Anomalies:** Many real-world anomalies are combinations of the above, requiring an integrated analysis of trajectory access location with time and structural features.2 For instance, a "circuitous route" is both a spatial and temporal anomaly.

The following table provides a foundational and structured understanding of what constitutes an "anomalous taxi trajectory" within the scope of the thesis. This clear categorization is indispensable for both the systematic generation of diverse anomalous data and the subsequent design and evaluation of effective anomaly detection and classification methods. It ensures a consistent definition of "anomaly" throughout the research.  
**Table 2: Taxonomy of Anomalies in Taxi Trajectories**

| Anomaly Type | Description | Examples | Potential Detection Features |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Spatial Deviation** | Unusual geographic path taken, not adhering to common routes or road networks. | Circuitous Route, Off-Road Travel, Significant Route Deviation from shortest path. | Distance from shortest path, deviation from popular routes, GPS point validity (on-road vs. off-road). |
| **Temporal Anomaly** | Unusual timing or duration of a trip or segment. | Unusually long/short trip duration for distance, travel during non-typical periods. | Trip duration vs. expected, time of day, frequency analysis of activity. |
| **Kinematic Outlier** | Violations of physical movement characteristics (speed, acceleration). | Excessive Speed, Abrupt Speed/Direction Change, Impossible Acceleration. | Speed vs. road limit, acceleration/deceleration values, turning angle changes. |
| **Contextual Anomaly** | Behavior normal in general, but unusual for a specific entity (e.g., driver, vehicle). | Unusual Route for Specific Driver, Taxi operating in non-typical zones for its usual pattern. | Deviation from user-specific historical patterns, perplexity score for user's trajectory. |
| **Hybrid Anomaly** | Combination of two or more basic anomaly types. | Circuitous route with excessive speed, unexpected stop in an unusual location for an extended duration. | Combined metrics from spatial, temporal, and kinematic analyses. |

### **3.2 Techniques for Controlled Anomaly Injection via Diffusion Models**

Given the inherent scarcity of real anomalous data, generating synthetic anomalies using guided or modified Diffusion Models (DMs) is a crucial strategy.9 DMs can generate realistic anomalous samples by interpolating between normal and abnormal data distributions.9 The concept of "controlled anomaly injection" represents a significant and active emerging theme in anomaly detection research. This paradigm shifts the focus from merely detecting pre-existing anomalies to  
*actively synthesizing* diverse and targeted anomalous data for the explicit purpose of training more robust and generalizable anomaly detection models.7 This signifies a strategic move from passive analysis to active data generation for enhancing AD system performance.  
Several techniques can be employed for controlled anomaly injection:

* **Conditional Generation:** DMs can be adapted to incorporate external information, such as class labels, masks, or descriptive text, directly into their denoising process.18 This "conditioning" allows for guiding the generation towards specific attributes or characteristics.25 For anomalous taxi trajectories, this means conditioning the reverse diffusion process on a vector or set of parameters representing the desired anomaly type and its intensity (e.g., "deviates from route X by Y meters," "maintains Z km/h over speed limit," "includes an unexpected stop of W minutes"). This can be achieved by modifying the input to the denoising U-Net architecture or by directly guiding the sampling process.10 For instance, a conditional diffusion model has been shown to generate trajectories conditioned on their "scores," which could represent an anomaly score.27 This suggests a path to generating trajectories that inherently exhibit a high anomaly score.  
* **Latent Space Manipulation:** DMs learn complex data distributions and compress them into a lower-dimensional "latent space." This latent space effectively preserves the essential features and underlying structure of the input data.7 Manipulating specific dimensions or regions within this latent space allows for fine-grained control over the generative aspects of the model.29 For anomaly generation, this involves identifying latent variables that correspond to "normal" trajectory features (e.g., typical speed profiles, adherence to road topology, directness of route). By perturbing these specific latent variables, one can push the generated trajectory towards an "anomalous" state.29 In image synthesis, DMs can "remove" or "transform" anomalous segments by blending them into the background.31 The inverse principle can be applied: strategically introduce features that are "out-of-distribution" within the latent space to synthesize a specific type of anomaly.  
* **Adversarial Perturbation:** This technique involves training a "perturbation generator" alongside the diffusion model. This generator creates perturbed samples that are subtly altered versions of normal data but are specifically designed to be challenging for a reconstruction model to accurately reproduce.33 For instance, DiffGAN incorporates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) component into the denoiser of a diffusion model. This allows for the simultaneous generation of noisy data and the prediction of diffusion steps, which can enhance anomaly detection by creating more robust anomalous samples.22 Adversarial examples can also be crafted directly in the latent space of diffusion models, leading to more imperceptible and transferable anomalies.34 This approach could be adapted to generate subtle, yet detectable, anomalous variations in taxi trajectories.  
* **Physics-Informed Diffusion Models:** A cutting-edge approach involves integrating physical kinematic constraints (e.g., limits on speed, acceleration, steering angle, and turning radius) directly into the diffusion model's loss function.35 This allows the model to generate trajectories that explicitly  
  *do not adhere to the laws of physics*, representing a distinct and highly relevant type of anomaly (e.g., instantaneous changes in direction, impossible accelerations).35 This method is particularly promising for detecting GPS spoofing or other physically implausible movements.35

### **3.3 Proposed Framework for Generating Anomalous Taxi Trajectories**

The methodology for generating anomalous taxi trajectories will integrate a multi-pronged approach, combining conditional generation with latent space manipulation, and potentially incorporating physics-informed regularization for specific anomaly types. The choice of the underlying base diffusion model (DiffTraj vs. Diff-RNTraj) profoundly influences the *nature* and *scope* of anomalies that can be generated. If Diff-RNTraj is chosen, its inherent road-network awareness 21 means that "normal" behavior is tightly constrained to roads. Consequently, anomalies generated by perturbing this model will predominantly be deviations  
*within* the road network (e.g., unusual routes, speeds on roads). Conversely, if DiffTraj is utilized, its more general spatial-temporal modeling 1 might facilitate the generation of  
*off-road* or *physically impossible* trajectories more readily. This highlights a critical design decision: the model's inductive biases dictate the "normal" manifold, and therefore, define the boundaries of the "anomalous" space it can effectively explore.  
The proposed framework consists of the following steps:

1. **Base Model Training:** A foundational diffusion model (either DiffTraj for general spatio-temporal patterns or Diff-RNTraj for road network-constrained realism) will be trained on a large dataset of *normal* taxi trajectories. This step establishes a robust understanding of the distribution of typical taxi behavior.10  
2. **Anomaly Definition and Parameterization:** Based on the detailed taxonomy of anomalies (Table 2), specific anomaly types will be defined and parameterized. This involves mapping qualitative anomaly descriptions (e.g., "speeding," "route deviation," "unexpected stop") into quantifiable parameters that can be used to condition or manipulate the generative process.  
3. **Conditional Anomaly Generation:** A conditional generation strategy will be implemented where the reverse diffusion process is guided by the anomaly parameters defined in Step 2\. This could involve modifying the input to the denoising network (e.g., U-Net) or using classifier-free guidance techniques to steer the generation towards anomalous characteristics.10  
4. **Latent Space Manipulation for Fine-Grained Control:** Techniques to manipulate the latent space of the trained diffusion model will be explored. This involves identifying latent dimensions that correlate with specific trajectory features (e.g., path smoothness, directness, speed profile). By perturbing these latent variables, fine-tuned control over the anomaly's characteristics can be achieved, allowing for the generation of novel, unseen anomalous patterns.29  
5. **Physics-Informed Regularization (Optional but Recommended):** For anomalies that involve violations of physical laws (e.g., GPS spoofing, impossible turns), a physics-based regularization loss will be integrated into the anomaly generation process. This ensures that the generated "anomalies" are truly out-of-distribution with respect to real-world kinematics, enhancing their realism for specific use cases.35  
6. **Synthetic Data Augmentation:** The generated anomalous trajectories, along with their corresponding anomaly labels (type and location), will be used to augment the training dataset for the anomaly detection models. This directly addresses the critical "anomaly data scarcity" problem 7 and is expected to significantly improve the robustness and performance of the downstream anomaly detection system.8

## **4\. Methodology for Anomaly Detection and Classification**

Anomaly detection (AD) is a critical and well-studied problem across various domains, aiming to identify instances that significantly deviate from established normal patterns.7 This section outlines the proposed anomaly detection and classification methodology for the generated taxi trajectories.

### **4.1 Review of State-of-the-Art Trajectory Anomaly Detection**

Historically, trajectory anomaly detection has employed distance-based and density-based algorithms 41, as well as statistical methods and nearest neighbor approaches.6 However, these traditional techniques often struggle with the scale, complexity, and high dimensionality of modern spatio-temporal data, frequently requiring extensive manual feature engineering and exhibiting limitations in adapting to evolving data distributions.39  
Deep learning has largely surpassed traditional methods in AD due to its ability to learn complex, high-dimensional features and patterns.43

* **Autoencoders (AEs):** AEs are a core component of many unsupervised deep anomaly detection models.43 They are trained predominantly on normal data, learning to compress and reconstruct it. The underlying principle for AD is that AEs will produce low reconstruction errors for normal instances but significantly higher errors for anomalous events, as they struggle to reconstruct out-of-distribution data.29 They can transform geometric features into sequence patterns for comprehensive representation.41  
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / LSTMs:** Given the sequential nature of trajectories, RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are highly effective for capturing spatio-temporal dependencies and long-term relationships within trajectory data.42 They can be used for tasks like sub-trajectory classification.42  
* **Transformer-based Models:** Recent advancements, particularly autoregressive causal-attention models, have shown promise in learning the probability distributions over trajectories.24 By predicting the next location given a historical context, these models can identify low-probability locations as anomalies. A key advantage is their ability to detect anomalies specific to individual users (by conditioning on user tokens) and to handle various trajectory representations (e.g., discretized GPS coordinates, qualitative staypoints). Metrics like perplexity can quantify the "unpredictability" of a trajectory or segment.24  
* **Clustering-Based Methods:** These methods group similar trajectories, with anomalous ones typically forming small, isolated clusters or being identified as outliers from majority clusters.3 Techniques like edit distance combined with hierarchical clustering can measure trajectory similarity.3 Single-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) clustering is also used to identify anomalous trajectories by defining a hypervolume containing normal data.46

### **4.2 Proposed Anomaly Detection/Classification Model**

The proposed anomaly detection and classification model will primarily leverage the inherent properties of diffusion models, augmented by techniques from sequential deep learning. The inherent generative capability of Diffusion Models, when trained exclusively on normal data, naturally gives rise to a powerful anomaly detection mechanism based on reconstruction error. This approach is more principled than many traditional methods because it directly leverages the model's core function of understanding and recreating normal data distributions. The scarcity of real-world anomalies 7 necessitates synthetic anomaly generation, which in turn enables more robust and effective training of these reconstruction-based anomaly detection models. This creates a reinforcing cycle where generation feeds detection, and detection can inform better generation.7

* **Leveraging Diffusion Model Reconstruction Error for Anomaly Scoring:** A fundamental principle in Diffusion Models for Anomaly Detection (DMAD) is that a DM, when trained exclusively on normal data, will exhibit a reduced ability to accurately reconstruct inputs that deviate significantly from its learned normal distribution.7 Therefore, the discrepancy between an input trajectory and its reconstructed version (quantified as the "reconstruction error") serves as a robust anomaly score.7 A larger reconstruction error directly implies a higher likelihood that the input trajectory is anomalous.7 This error can be measured using standard distance metrics such as L1 or L2 loss, or more advanced "perceptual loss" that compares high-level features extracted by pre-trained networks, capturing semantic rather than pixel-wise differences.7 Further refinement can involve aggregating errors across intermediate diffusion states at varying noise levels.7  
* **User-Specific Anomaly Detection and Perplexity-Based Metrics:** For detecting contextual anomalies (i.e., behavior that is normal in general but anomalous for a specific user), the anomaly detection model can be conditioned on a unique user identifier (user token). This allows the model to learn and flag deviations from an individual user's typical movement patterns.24 Perplexity, a well-established metric from Natural Language Processing (NLP), can be adapted to measure the uncertainty of the model when predicting the next location in a trajectory.24 A high perplexity score for a trajectory, or a segment within it, would indicate that it is an outlier or anomalous. The "surprisal rate" can further pinpoint the exact anomalous locations within a trajectory.24 The successful application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics, such as perplexity 24, to trajectory data signifies a growing convergence of techniques and conceptual frameworks across different AI domains. This highlights the fundamental sequential nature of trajectories, akin to language, and suggests that insights from one field can be powerfully transferred to another. This cross-domain methodological transfer could lead to more nuanced and interpretable anomaly detection, not only at the coarse-grained trajectory level but also at specific, fine-grained points or segments within a trajectory.  
* **Integration with Synthetically Generated Anomalies for Robust Training:** The synthetically generated anomalous trajectories (as detailed in Section 3\) will be an indispensable resource for training and validating the anomaly detection model. This directly addresses the critical "anomaly data scarcity" problem.7 This approach facilitates semi-supervised or weakly supervised training paradigms, where the model can learn from a dominant class of normal data augmented with a controlled, sparse class of anomalous data. This strategy is proven to significantly improve the robustness and overall performance of anomaly detection systems.8

The following table provides a structured, comparative overview of both established and proposed anomaly detection and classification methods relevant to trajectories. It allows for a clear justification of the chosen approach within the thesis, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the state-of-the-art and highlighting why specific methods (e.g., DM-based reconstruction, transformer-based models) are particularly well-suited for the complexities of spatio-temporal trajectory data and the problem of detecting generated anomalies.  
**Table 3: Key Anomaly Detection/Classification Methods for Trajectories**

| Method Category | Specific Algorithms/Approaches | Strengths | Limitations | Suitability for Taxi Trajectories |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Traditional** | Distance-based, Density-based, SNN-CAD 6 | Simplicity, interpretability for basic deviations. | Manual feature engineering, struggles with high-dimensionality, evolving distributions.39 | Limited for complex spatio-temporal patterns and large datasets. |
| **Deep Learning (Reconstruction-based)** | Autoencoders, Diffusion Model Reconstruction Error 7 | Unsupervised learning, learns high-dimensional features, effective for out-of-distribution detection. | "Identity shortcut" problem (reconstructing anomalies too well), computational cost.18 | High, especially for detecting deviations from learned normal patterns. |
| **Deep Learning (Sequential)** | RNN/LSTM, Autoregressive Causal-Attention Model (Perplexity) 24 | Captures temporal dependencies, user-specific anomaly detection, fine-grained anomaly localization. | Can be computationally intensive, requires careful sequence representation. | High, particularly for behavioral and contextual anomalies. |
| **Clustering-based** | Edit distance \+ Hierarchical Clustering, One-class SVM 3 | Identifies outliers, groups similar patterns. | Sensitivity to distance metrics, scalability for massive datasets, defining optimal clusters. | Moderate, useful for identifying minority driving patterns. |

## **5\. Evaluation Framework for Synthetic and Anomalous Trajectories**

A robust evaluation framework is essential to validate the quality, utility, and privacy of the generated synthetic and anomalous taxi trajectories, as well as the performance of the anomaly detection system.

### **5.1 Evaluating Synthetic Trajectory Data Quality and Utility**

The evaluation of synthetic trajectory data involves assessing both its resemblance to real data and its utility for downstream tasks.

* **Role of LibCity for Downstream Trajectory Tasks:** LibCity (and its broader framework BIGCity) is a unified, comprehensive, and extensible library primarily designed for *traffic prediction* and related spatio-temporal tasks within smart cities.48 It supports a range of downstream tasks highly relevant to trajectory data, including Trajectory Next-Location Prediction, Travel Time Estimation (TTE), Most Similar Trajectory Search (Simi), and Trajectory Classification (CLAS).48  
  LibCity provides standardized evaluation metrics for these specific tasks, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for TTE, and Accuracy (ACC), F1-score (F1), and Area Under ROC (AUC) for classification.49 The generated synthetic normal and anomalous taxi trajectories can be used as input to  
  LibCity models. This allows for assessing the *utility* of the synthetic data by evaluating if a model trained on synthetic data performs comparably to one trained on real data for a specific downstream task (e.g., next-location prediction). It can also be used to evaluate if a LibCity classification model can effectively distinguish between generated normal and anomalous trajectories.  
* **Comprehensive Synthetic Data Evaluation with SDMetrics:** While LibCity is valuable for evaluating the *utility* of synthetic data in specific downstream tasks, it does not provide a comprehensive suite of metrics for evaluating the *intrinsic quality and privacy* of synthetic data itself. For this, the SDMetrics library is proposed. SDMetrics is an open-source Python library specifically designed for evaluating tabular synthetic data, including time series data, by comparing it against real data.51 It offers a variety of metrics across three dimensions: resemblance, utility, and privacy.54  
  * **Resemblance Metrics:** These metrics assess how statistically similar the synthetic data is to the real data. For time series (trajectories), this includes metrics for:  
    * **Sequence Length Similarity:** Comparing the distribution of sequence lengths between real and synthetic trajectories.51  
    * **Statistical Similarity:** Evaluating statistical properties of individual columns (e.g., latitude, longitude, timestamp, speed) and their correlations.51 This involves metrics like  
      KSComplement (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for distribution similarity) and CorrelationSimilarity.51  
    * **Univariate and Multivariate Resemblance Analysis:** Detailed comparisons of single-column distributions and relationships between multiple columns.54  
  * **Utility Metrics:** These evaluate how well the synthetic data can be used for machine learning tasks, often by comparing model performance when trained on real versus synthetic data. SDMetrics provides ML Efficacy metrics, including BinaryClassifierPrecisionEfficacy and BinaryClassifierRecallEfficacy.51 This aligns with the  
    Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) approach.54  
  * **Privacy Metrics:** These are crucial for assessing whether the synthetic data leaks sensitive information about the real data. SDMetrics includes DisclosureProtection metrics, which measure the level of protection against re-identification.51 Other metrics like  
    Membership Inference Attack (MIA) simulation and Attribute Inference Attack (AIA) simulation can also be employed.54

### **5.2 Evaluating Anomaly Detection and Classification Performance**

The performance of the anomaly detection and classification model will be rigorously evaluated using standard metrics and specialized approaches for imbalanced datasets, which are common in anomaly detection due to the scarcity of anomalous instances.

* **Classification Metrics:** For binary classification (normal vs. anomalous), standard metrics include:  
  * **Accuracy (ACC):** Overall correctness of predictions.49  
  * **Precision:** Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.  
  * **Recall (Sensitivity):** Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.  
  * **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.3  
  * **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) / Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC):** These metrics evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between classes across various thresholds, with AUPRC being more informative for highly imbalanced datasets. AUROC is a common metric in anomaly detection.18  
* **Anomaly Scoring Metrics:** For models that output an anomaly score (e.g., reconstruction error from diffusion models), evaluation involves:  
  * **Thresholding:** Determining an optimal threshold to classify scores as normal or anomalous.  
  * **Surprisal Rate:** For sequential models, this can pinpoint specific anomalous locations within a trajectory.24  
  * **Reconstruction Error Analysis:** Directly analyzing the distribution of reconstruction errors for normal vs. anomalous data.  
* **Trajectory-Specific Metrics:**  
  * **Distance-based measures:** Comparing generated anomalous trajectories to known anomalous patterns using metrics like Hausdorff distance.6  
  * **Trajectory quality assessment:** Evaluating the "smoothness" and "plausibility" of generated trajectories, even anomalous ones, to ensure they represent realistic deviations rather than random noise. This can involve assessing the stability of movement features like turning angle, length, duration, and speed.5  
* **Statistical Significance Testing:** To ensure the robustness of the results, statistical tests (e.g., pairwise t-tests) will be employed to demonstrate the significance of performance improvements compared to baseline methods.55

## **6\. Privacy Considerations in Synthetic Trajectory Data**

The generation and use of synthetic trajectory data, while addressing data scarcity, must rigorously uphold privacy standards given the sensitive nature of location information. This section details the critical privacy considerations and mechanisms.

### **6.1 Importance of Privacy in Trajectory Data**

GPS trajectory data inherently contains sensitive personal geolocation information, which, if directly collected or published, can lead to serious privacy concerns.1 This includes the potential for re-identification of individuals and inference of sensitive personal details such as home addresses, workplaces, political preferences, or health status.11 Attackers can leverage background knowledge and the semantic information of locations to make inferences, leading to semantic-based attacks or area boundary attacks.13 Therefore, developing methods that facilitate the efficient use of trajectory data in urban applications while safeguarding personal privacy is essential.1

### **6.2 Differential Privacy Mechanisms**

Differential Privacy (DP) is widely regarded as the "golden standard" for privacy protection, offering a rigorous and mathematically provable privacy guarantee.4 Unlike traditional privacy models (e.g., k-anonymity, l-diversity) that rely on assumptions about an attacker's background knowledge and can be vulnerable to various attacks, DP ensures that the output of an analysis is nearly indistinguishable whether or not any single individual's data is included in the input dataset.4

* **Local Differential Privacy (LDP):** In a decentralized setting, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables individual users to perturb their trajectories locally before sending the sanitized data to an untrusted server.12 This removes the reliance on a trusted third party, which is a common vulnerability in centralized DP approaches.14 LDP provides a provable privacy guarantee by ensuring that each point in a defined location set has a probability of being included in the perturbed output.12  
* **Implementation Challenges and Solutions for Trajectories:** Implementing DP for trajectory data presents unique challenges. The large domain of location points can lead to perturbed points being far from the real ones, resulting in poor data utility.12 Additionally, real-world trajectories have a natural restriction on the distance between neighboring points. To address this, approaches like "pivot sampling perturbation" use adjacent direction information to restrict the possible region of a perturbed point, enhancing utility without violating privacy constraints.12 Other methods involve clustering locations into feature regions and applying mechanisms like the exponential mechanism to select confusion points, ensuring that generated locations conform to a uniform distribution while reflecting trajectory features.4 Personalization of privacy budgets, allowing users to strengthen protection for sensitive points, is also a key advancement.14  
* **Utility-Privacy Trade-off:** A critical aspect of DP is the inherent trade-off between privacy guarantees and data utility.4 Achieving a favorable balance remains challenging, particularly for complex trajectory data. Research indicates that DP-SGD (Differential Privacy Stochastic Gradient Descent) can significantly impact the performance of generative models, although some utility can be retained with sufficiently large datasets.11 This suggests that while diffusion models offer inherent privacy through their generative process (as discussed in Section 2), formal DP guarantees may require careful integration and evaluation of their utility cost.

### **6.3 K-Anonymity for Location Data**

K-anonymity is a data anonymization technique used to protect individuals' privacy by ensuring that for every combination of identifying attributes in a dataset, there are at least 'K minus 1' other people with the same attributes.58 This is achieved through data generalization (e.g., replacing exact ages with age ranges) or suppression of identifying information.58 While K-anonymity can be effective for masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and maintaining data functionality for analysis 58, it has limitations, particularly for trajectory data. K-anonymity methods are vulnerable to attacks with background knowledge 4 and cannot prevent continuous location tracking and identification.57 Algorithms like Datafly and Samarati have been proposed to find k-anonymous datasets, but they often struggle with global optimality on information loss.59 Given the dynamic and sequential nature of trajectories, K-anonymity alone is often insufficient for robust privacy protection compared to the stronger guarantees offered by differential privacy.

## **7\. Conclusions**

This comprehensive methodology outlines a robust approach for generating and detecting anomalous taxi trajectories using advanced diffusion models, directly addressing the critical challenges of data scarcity for anomalous events and privacy concerns in spatio-temporal data.  
The selection between DiffTraj and Diff-RNTraj as foundational generative models presents a crucial design decision, as each offers a distinct balance between general spatio-temporal modeling and road-network constrained realism. DiffTraj, with its ability to generate from random noise, inherently provides a degree of privacy and flexibility for creating a wide range of anomalies, including those that deviate significantly from road networks. Conversely, Diff-RNTraj, by explicitly incorporating road network information, excels at producing realistic normal taxi trajectories, making it suitable for generating anomalies that are deviations *within* the road network. The choice depends on the specific types of anomalies targeted, with a hybrid approach potentially offering the most comprehensive solution.  
The proposed methodology for anomalous trajectory generation leverages cutting-edge techniques such as conditional generation, latent space manipulation, adversarial perturbation, and physics-informed diffusion models. These methods enable the controlled synthesis of diverse and targeted anomalous data, effectively overcoming the inherent scarcity of real-world anomalous samples. This active synthesis of anomalies is a significant paradigm shift, moving beyond passive analysis to directly augment datasets for training more robust anomaly detection systems.  
For anomaly detection and classification, the methodology proposes leveraging the reconstruction error of diffusion models trained on normal data, as their inability to accurately reconstruct out-of-distribution inputs provides a principled anomaly score. Furthermore, the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics like perplexity for user-specific and fine-grained anomaly detection within trajectories represents a promising cross-domain transfer of knowledge. This approach allows for identifying not only anomalous trajectories but also the specific points or segments where anomalies occur, enhancing interpretability and actionability.  
The evaluation framework emphasizes a multi-faceted approach. While LibCity can assess the utility of synthetic data for downstream traffic prediction tasks, the SDMetrics library is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the synthetic data's intrinsic quality, resemblance to real data, and privacy guarantees. The inclusion of privacy metrics, particularly those related to Differential Privacy, is paramount for ensuring that the generated synthetic data is not only useful but also ethically sound and compliant with privacy regulations.  
In conclusion, this methodology offers a sophisticated and practical framework for advancing the field of spatio-temporal anomaly detection. By synergistically combining advanced generative AI with rigorous privacy measures and comprehensive evaluation, it paves the way for developing more effective, ethical, and deployable AI systems for critical urban mobility applications, ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient smart cities.
