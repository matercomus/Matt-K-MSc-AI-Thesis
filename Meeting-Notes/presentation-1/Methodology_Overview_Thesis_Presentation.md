## üìã Executive Summary

### Research Problem
- **Challenge:** Real taxi trajectory data contains sensitive location information that limits research access
- **Gap:** Traditional privacy methods destroy spatio-temporal patterns needed for anomaly detection
- **Need:** Framework for generating synthetic taxi trajectories that preserve anomaly detection utility while ensuring privacy

### Solution Approach
**Integrated 3-Phase Framework** combining:
- **DiffTraj** (diffusion-based generation) + **LM-TAD** (language model anomaly detection)
- Iterative refinement process to bootstrap anomaly generation without pre-labeled data
- Multiple privacy protection mechanisms integrated throughout pipeline

## üî¨ Core Methodology Framework

### Phase 1: Baseline Synthetic Data Generation
```
Real Normal Trajectories ‚Üí DiffTraj Training ‚Üí Synthetic Normal Dataset
```

**Key Components:**
- **Model:** DiffTraj (1D-CNN-based diffusion model)
- **Input:** Filtered normal taxi trajectories (statistical thresholds applied)
- **Training:** Multi-criteria filtering (trip duration, distance efficiency, temporal patterns)
- **Output:** High-fidelity synthetic normal trajectories with privacy by design

**Rationale:** 
- Diffusion models provide superior training stability vs GANs
- No direct copying ensures inherent privacy protection
- Foundation dataset for anomaly mining process

### Phase 2: Unsupervised Anomaly Mining and Curation
```
Synthetic Data ‚Üí LM-TAD Detection ‚Üí Diverse Querying ‚Üí Rule-Based Curation ‚Üí Labeled Anomalies
```

**Key Components:**

1. **LM-TAD Anomaly Detection**
   - Autoregressive transformer treating trajectories as token sequences
   - Perplexity-based anomaly scoring (higher perplexity = more anomalous)
   - No pre-labeled anomaly data required

2. **Diverse Querying (k-means++ Selection)**
   - Based on SOEL framework for maximum labeling efficiency
   - Selects maximally diverse trajectories in feature space
   - Focuses manual review effort on representative samples

3. **Rule-Based Categorization**
   - Route Deviation: Path length > Normal + threshold
   - Temporal Delay: Travel time > Normal + threshold  
   - Kinematic Outliers: Speed/behavior violations
   - Off-Road Driving: GPS points away from road network

**Output:** Categorized anomaly datasets (speeding, off-road, route deviation, etc.)

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement and Conditional Generation
```
Normal + Anomalies ‚Üí Enriched Training ‚Üí Refined DiffTraj ‚Üí Conditional Generation
```

**Key Components:**
- **Enriched Retraining:** DiffTraj trained on combined normal + curated anomalies
- **Iterative Amplification:** Multiple cycles of generation ‚Üí detection ‚Üí curation ‚Üí retraining
- **Controlled Generation:** Final model supports conditional sampling by anomaly type

**Benefits:**
- Progressively improves anomaly diversity and quality
- Enables targeted generation of specific anomaly types
- Maintains balance to prevent mode collapse

## üîí Privacy Protection Strategy

### Multi-Layer Privacy Approach

1. **Differential Privacy Integration**
   - DP-SGD during DiffTraj training
   - Bounded individual trajectory influence
   - Privacy budget allocation: Œµ‚ÇÅ=2.0 (baseline), Œµ‚ÇÇ=1.0 (refinement), Œµ‚ÇÉ=0.5 (evaluation)

2. **Trajectory-Level Protection**
   - Entire trajectories as atomic privacy units
   - Prevents correlation attacks within trajectories
   - Spatial generalization through grid-based discretization

3. **Synthetic Data Decoupling**
   - Generated from learned distributions, not direct copies
   - No individual trajectory reconstruction possible
   - Fundamental privacy guarantee through generative approach

4. **Attack Resistance**
   - Defense against membership inference attacks
   - Protection against reconstruction attacks
   - Iterative refinement diminishes individual influence

## üß™ Experimental Design

### Validation Strategy
- **Primary Development:** Beijing taxi dataset (Nov 25 - Dec 1, 2019)
- **Cross-City Validation:** Independent pipeline execution on Chengdu and Xi'an datasets
- **Per-City Approach:** Separate models, privacy budgets, and training for each city

### Evaluation Framework

**1. Anomaly Detection Performance**
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- AUC-ROC and AUC-PR curves
- Performance across different anomaly categories

**2. Synthetic Data Quality**
- SDMetrics standardized assessment (Resemblance, Utility, Privacy)
- Statistical fidelity (KS-test, Jensen-Shannon divergence)
- Downstream task performance validation

**3. Privacy Preservation Assessment**
- Membership inference attack resistance
- Trajectory reconstruction attack evaluation
- Privacy-utility trade-off quantification
