## **2\. Introduction to Trajectory Generation and Prediction in AI**

### **2.1. Defining Trajectory Generation and Prediction**

Trajectory prediction involves the estimation of an entity's future path, drawing upon its current position and historical movement data.1 This forecasting capability is a fundamental requirement across various autonomous systems. For instance, in autonomous driving, predicting the paths of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians is essential for safe and efficient navigation.3  
While often used interchangeably with prediction, **trajectory generation specifically refers to the synthesis of entirely new, plausible trajectories**. This synthetic generation is crucial for applications such as simulation, planning, and **data augmentation for training machine learning models**. For a master's thesis focused on "trajectory generation," the primary objective is to **fabricate novel, realistic paths that adhere to observed mobility patterns**. This distinction is critical for precisely defining the scope of research, as models capable of high-fidelity prediction often serve as foundational components for broader generation tasks. The ability of a model to learn the underlying data distribution, as seen in generative models, enables it to both predict future states and synthesize entirely new, plausible trajectories.

### **2.2. Importance in Autonomous Systems and Urban Mobility**

The accurate modeling and generation of trajectories are cornerstones in the development of intelligent systems, playing a critical role in enabling vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently within dynamic environments.3 In the realm of autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is indispensable for planning and executing safe maneuvers, especially in complex traffic scenarios.5  
Beyond autonomous vehicles, trajectory prediction and generation are crucial for the development of intelligent transportation systems, including taxi and rideshare services. These capabilities are vital for enhancing customer experience and optimizing resource management.7 For example, precise predictions of travel time and distance are paramount for efficient service delivery.7 The significance of this field extends further into human-centric environments, supporting applications in autonomous navigation, robotics, and crowd modeling.1 The capacity to anticipate human movement is fundamental for social robots and self-driving cars that share public spaces with pedestrians.2  
The pervasive relevance of trajectory computing is evident across diverse applications, including urban planning, traffic control, and public safety.10 It also contributes to logistics optimization and the provision of personalized location-based services.10 The repeated emphasis on the "critical role" and "widespread attention" given to trajectory computing across these varied domains underscores its profound real-world impact. Accurate trajectory prediction and generation directly translate into improved safety, such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving, and enhanced efficiency, exemplified by optimized taxi dispatch and reduced passenger waiting times. This capability also enables more effective resource management within complex, dynamic urban systems. Consequently, research in this area, such as a master's thesis on taxi trajectory generation, holds substantial relevance and potential for tangible societal benefits, extending beyond theoretical AI advancements to practical applications in intelligent urban environments,  
**including the crucial task of generating synthetic mobility datasets for urban planning and testing new transportation policies and systems**.

## **3\. State-of-the-Art in Taxi Trajectory Generation and Prediction**

### **3.1. Evolution of Methods: From Traditional to Deep Learning**

The evolution of trajectory prediction and generation methods has progressed significantly from rudimentary techniques to sophisticated deep learning models. Early approaches primarily relied on manual feature engineering and rule-based techniques, such as linear regression and Kalman filters.3 While foundational, these methods were inherently limited in their capacity to capture the intricate, non-linear interactions prevalent in dynamic environments.3  
The advent of deep learning marked a transformative period, enabling researchers to leverage powerful architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These models demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and long-range dependencies within sequential data, leading to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy.14 Further advancements saw the rise of generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), which gained prominence in trajectory prediction.3 This progression from simpler statistical models to complex deep learning architectures, and specifically to generative models, reflects a fundamental understanding: real-world trajectories are inherently uncertain and multi-modal. Traditional rule-based or deterministic models, by their very nature, cannot adequately capture this complexity. The limitations of these earlier methods, such as their inability to model complex interactions and non-linearities, directly spurred the adoption of deep learning. Furthermore, the recognition that a moving entity, such as a taxi, might have several plausible future routes or destinations, necessitated the development of models that could represent and generate these multiple possibilities. This inherent multi-modal nature of future possibilities is a key reason why generative models have become indispensable for achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic scenarios,  
**especially for the purpose of synthesizing diverse and high-quality trajectories for training and simulation**.

### **3.2. Key Deep Learning Models and Architectures**

Deep learning has provided a rich set of tools for trajectory generation and prediction, with several architectural paradigms dominating the state-of-the-art. These models are particularly adept at processing and learning from GPS trajectory data.  
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs:** These networks are foundational for processing sequential data, such as GPS coordinate sequences, and have been extensively used to capture temporal correlations in trajectories.5 However, directly applying RNNs to trajectory modeling presents challenges due to the unique topological constraints imposed by road networks, where transitions are only possible between adjacent road segments.13 To address this, modified architectures like the Spatio-Temporal Neural Network (ST-NN) have been proposed, which first predict travel distance and then combine it with time-of-day information to predict travel time, demonstrating better generalization than earlier methods.7 Similarly, Spatio-Temporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) models embed spatial interactions into LSTMs to implicitly measure interactions between neighboring vehicles, enhancing vehicle trajectory prediction.5  
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs have been effectively applied by converting taxi trajectories (often represented by GPS points) into two-dimensional grids, allowing the leverage of computer vision techniques for prediction.14 For instance, the Deep learning-based Map Generation (DeepMG) framework utilizes a convolutional deep neural network called T2RNet to infer road centerlines directly from taxi trajectory data, facilitating the generation of routable maps.23  
**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs):** These generative models have become prominent for their ability to model the complex distributions of trajectories, including those derived from GPS data, and are widely applied for synthetic trajectory generation.24 The Trajectory Generation framework based on the Diffusion Model (TrajGDM) leverages concepts from VAEs, GANs, and Diffusion models to capture universal mobility patterns within trajectory datasets.24 This framework models trajectory generation as a step-by-step uncertainty-reducing process, enabling the creation of diverse and high-quality synthetic trajectories.24 Conditional GAN (CGAN) models have also been employed for taxi-passenger demand prediction, combining a modified DBSCAN algorithm for spatial correlation with LSTM-based generative and discriminative networks, often utilizing GPS taxi data as a primary input.19 VAEs are popular for generating trajectories while ensuring spatio-temporal validity constraints.25  
**Diffusion Models:** These models are emerging as a leading state-of-the-art approach due to their remarkable capacity to represent high-dimensional data distributions and facilitate controllable trajectory generation.26 CDSTraj, a novel trajectory prediction model, utilizes a Characterized Diffusion Module to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty and a Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module to capture nuanced effects on vehicle dynamics. This dual architecture, which enriches the predictive process with detailed semantic information, has achieved state-of-the-art results on various autonomous driving datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD.3 TrajGDM explicitly models the trajectory generation process as an uncertainty-reducing sequence, where a deep learning network iteratively estimates and removes uncertainty, generating detailed trajectories from a latent representation.24 Furthermore, MotionDiffuser, a 2023 CVPR paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models for controllable multi-agent motion prediction.17 Notably,  
**DiffTraj is a spatial-temporal diffusion probabilistic model specifically designed for GPS trajectory generation, capable of capturing complex behaviors and generating high-quality, privacy-preserving trajectories directly from raw GPS data**. **This model can generate infinite trajectories while preserving the real-world trajectory distribution**. TrajLearn is another novel model that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation for trajectory prediction, showing significant performance gains on real-world trajectory datasets.1  
**Diff-RNTraj is a diffusion model specifically designed for road network-constrained trajectory generation, directly generating trajectories on the road network with road-related information from hybrid data (discrete road segments and continuous moving rates)**.  
The increasing prominence of diffusion models, alongside GANs and VAEs, as state-of-the-art generative models for trajectory forecasting, signals a significant advancement. This is not merely a trend, but a direct consequence of their unique strengths in handling the inherent stochasticity and multi-modality of real-world movements. The explicit focus on "uncertainty mitigation" 3, "uncertainty-reducing processes" 24, and "controllable trajectory generation" 26 highlights how diffusion models are particularly adept at capturing the complex distributions of  
*possible* future trajectories, rather than just a single average path. This capability is crucial for scenarios requiring diverse and realistic outputs, such as simulating various traffic outcomes or exploring different rebalancing strategies for a taxi fleet. For a master's thesis, investigating diffusion models for taxi trajectory generation, especially those designed for raw GPS data and synthetic data creation, presents a highly promising and current research direction.

### **3.3. Prominent Datasets for Taxi Trajectories**

The advancement of taxi trajectory generation and prediction heavily relies on the availability of rich, real-world datasets, particularly those derived from GPS. These datasets are crucial for learning the underlying mobility patterns necessary for high-fidelity synthetic data generation. Several prominent datasets have been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of research in this domain:

* **Beijing Taxi Dataset (TaxiBJ):** This dataset is highly relevant as it consists of trajectory data from taxicab GPS data and meteorology data in Beijing. It covers four distinct time intervals: July 1st to October 30th, 2013; March 1st to June 30th, 2014; March 1st to June 30th, 2015; and November 1st, 2015 to April 10th, 2016\. This dataset has been used to investigate attributes of taxicabs, such as occupied distance, number of active taxis, average trip speed, and to identify operational patterns like 'downtown preference type' or 'long-distance preference type'. The availability of such a detailed GPS dataset from Beijing provides a strong foundation for your thesis, particularly for learning real-world distributions to generate synthetic data.  
* **Porto Taxi Dataset:** This dataset comprises accurate trajectories recorded by 442 taxis operating in Porto, Portugal. Each data sample corresponds to a completed trip and includes nine distinct features: TRIP\_ID (unique identifier), CALL\_TYPE (how the service was demanded, e.g., central dispatch, direct stand, or random street), ORIGIN\_CALL (customer identifier if centrally dispatched), ORIGIN\_STAND (taxi stand identifier if demanded directly), TAXI\_ID (driver identifier), TIMESTAMP (Unix timestamp of trip start), and DAYTYPE (day classification, e.g., normal, holiday, or day before holiday).27 The trajectories themselves are sequences of coordinate pairs recorded every 15 seconds, with the first item representing the trip's start and the last its destination.27 This dataset was notably used in the ECML PKDD 2015 prediction challenge.16 The detailed features of the Porto dataset underscore that taxi trajectory data encompasses more than just raw GPS coordinates; it includes rich contextual information. This multi-faceted nature suggests that effective models must integrate diverse data types to fully capture the nuances of taxi movements, which is crucial for generating realistic synthetic data.  
* **NYC Taxi Dataset / Manhattan-taxi-trajectories Dataset:** This dataset contains extensive taxi trip data collected from GPS-enabled taxis in New York City. It has been widely utilized for tasks such as travel time and distance prediction.7 The Manhattan-taxi-trajectories dataset specifically consists of 1,000 processed taxi trajectories over a one-year period, represented as sequences of visited neighborhoods in Manhattan. Transitions are derived from pickup and dropoff records, and the dataset also accounts for an "outside Manhattan" state.28  
* **NGSIM (Next Generation Simulation), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) Datasets:** While primarily used in the context of autonomous driving, these datasets are also highly relevant as they contain trajectory data for various road agents, including vehicles that behave similarly to taxis. NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, covering diverse scenarios such as highways, urban streets, and intersections.3 The HighD dataset, for instance, is collected using wide-area remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), providing precise data on vehicle dynamics and road structures.18

The availability of such rich, real-world datasets, including the Beijing, Porto, and NYC taxi datasets, is a significant enabler for research in this field. However, it also presents challenges in terms of processing and effectively utilizing all available features, often leading to the development of complex input representations for deep learning models, particularly when the goal is to learn distributions for synthetic data generation.

### **3.4. Applications in Taxi Services**

The capabilities derived from advanced taxi trajectory generation and prediction extend far beyond simple forecasting, serving as fundamental building blocks for sophisticated urban intelligence initiatives, often leveraging GPS data as their core input.

* **Travel Time and Distance Estimation:** Accurate prediction of travel time and distance is crucial for enhancing customer experience and optimizing resource management within taxi and rideshare services.7 Deep neural networks, such as the Spatio-Temporal Neural Network (ST-NN), have been developed to jointly predict trip time and distance directly from raw trip data (including GPS coordinates), bypassing the need for extensive feature engineering and demonstrating superior generalization compared to earlier methods.7 Modern deep learning methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance in travel time estimation.10  
* **Demand Forecasting and Fleet Management:** Predicting taxi-passenger demand is essential for addressing the imbalance between supply and demand, thereby reducing passenger waiting times and increasing taxi operator profits.19 Deep learning frameworks, including those combining modified DBSCAN with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and hybrid models integrating Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), have been proposed to predict taxi demand by considering spatial, temporal, and external dependencies. These models often extract main features from multi-source data, including GPS taxi data, road network data, weather data, and points of interest.19 These models aim to enhance the efficiency of passenger search and optimize fleet operations. Furthermore, the Trajectory Foundation Model (TrajFM) is being developed as a vehicle trajectory foundation model designed for region and task transferability, which is highly relevant for scalable fleet management across different urban areas, utilizing (location, time) pairs from vehicle trajectories.15  
* **Route Recommendation:** Trajectory modeling offers the potential to guide self-driving taxis along popular routes to maximize the likelihood of finding potential commuters, or conversely, along less popular trajectories to alleviate traffic congestion.13 This capability, often informed by historical GPS routes, can significantly improve the efficiency of taxi dispatch and urban traffic flow.  
* **Map Generation and Recovery:** Taxi trajectory data, particularly GPS data, can be leveraged to generate and update road network information. The Deep learning-based Map Generation (DeepMG) framework, for instance, learns the structure of existing road networks from taxi trajectory data to create routable maps, effectively handling noisy GPS positions and distinguishing between parallel road segments.23 This framework extracts features from trajectories in both spatial and transition views, using a convolutional deep neural network (T2RNet) to infer road centerlines.23 Additionally, deep learning methods are employed for trajectory recovery, enabling the reconstruction of missing portions of trajectories, which is vital for maintaining data integrity and completeness.10 Map matching, a crucial pre-processing step, transforms raw GPS trajectory data into coherent road segments on a map, addressing issues like data sparsity and noise. Diff-RNTraj is a diffusion model specifically designed for road network-constrained trajectory generation, directly generating trajectories on the road network with road-related information from hybrid data (discrete road segments and continuous moving rates).  
* **Mobility Simulation and Synthesis (Synthetic Data Generation):** The ability to generate synthetic mobility datasets based on observed real-world mobility patterns is crucial for urban planning and for testing new transportation policies and systems. This involves learning the universal mobility pattern from real data (often GPS trajectories) to produce high-quality, diverse, and realistic synthetic trajectories. Diffusion models are particularly effective for this, as they can emulate the spatial-temporal behavior of original trajectory data and retain geo-distribution and statistical properties, while also addressing privacy concerns by generating privacy-free alternatives. This capability is vital for overcoming data scarcity and privacy issues associated with real-world GPS data.

These diverse applications demonstrate that "trajectory generation" for taxis is not merely about predicting movement but serves as a foundational element for broader "smart city" initiatives. This encompasses optimizing entire urban transportation ecosystems, leading to significant real-world problem-solving and offering a rich area for practical application and impact within urban computing and intelligent transportation systems.

## **4\. Related Research: Human Trajectory Generation and Prediction**

### **4.1. Overview of Human Motion Forecasting and its Challenges**

Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) focuses on forecasting the future movements of individuals or groups, conditioned on observations of their past behaviors and application-dependent contextual data.21 This capability is of paramount importance for autonomous platforms, such as self-driving cars and social robots, which increasingly share and navigate environments alongside humans.2 The ability to anticipate human motion is critical for safe navigation, effective planning, and seamless human-robot interaction.22  
However, predicting human behavior is inherently complex due to several key challenges:

* **Interpersonal Interactions:** Human motion is highly interdependent, meaning each person's movement is influenced by and adapts to the people around them. Humans possess an innate ability to interpret the behavior of others in crowds, and jointly modeling these intricate dependencies is a significant hurdle.29  
* **Social Acceptability:** Not all physically possible trajectories are socially acceptable. Pedestrians adhere to unwritten social norms, such such as yielding right-of-way or respecting personal space. Formalizing and integrating these social conventions into predictive models is a non-trivial task.29  
* **Multi-modality:** Given a partial history of movement, there is rarely a single "correct" future prediction. Instead, multiple distinct trajectories can be plausible and socially acceptable. Models must be capable of capturing this inherent ambiguity and generating a diverse set of potential future paths.29

Historically, HTP relied on physics-based models, such as the Social Force Model (SFM) and velocity-based approaches like Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) or Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA).21 These models conceptualized pedestrians as particles influenced by attractive and repulsive forces. However, the field has largely transitioned from these expert-driven, physics-based models to data-driven deep learning approaches.21 This shift occurred because physics-based models, while providing foundational insights, were limited in their ability to capture the full complexity of human interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. The repeated emphasis on "interpersonal," "socially acceptable," and "multimodal" challenges highlights that human behavior is far more nuanced than can be captured by simple physics or hand-crafted rules. The inherent social and multi-modal nature of human movement directly necessitates models that can capture complex interactions and generate diverse, plausible outcomes, which is why generative deep learning models have become so prevalent in HTP,  
**and are highly relevant for generating realistic synthetic human trajectory data**.30

### **4.2. Advanced Deep Learning Models for Human Trajectory Prediction**

The challenges of human trajectory prediction, particularly multi-modality and complex social interactions, have driven the development of sophisticated deep learning models. These models are also highly relevant for generating synthetic human trajectory data.  
**Social GAN (SGAN):** This pioneering model addresses human motion prediction in crowded scenes by combining sequence prediction with generative adversarial networks.2 SGAN employs a recurrent sequence-to-sequence generator that observes motion histories and predicts future behavior. A key innovation is its novel pooling mechanism, which aggregates information across multiple people in a scene to model human-human interactions effectively.2 Unlike prior work that focused on local neighborhoods, SGAN's pooling learns a "global" vector, enabling efficient interaction modeling.2 To address the multi-modal nature of human movement and encourage diverse predictions, SGAN introduces a "variety loss" that prompts the generative network to explore the space of possible paths while maintaining consistency with observed inputs.2  
**PECNet (Predicted Endpoint Conditioned Network):** PECNet is designed for flexible human trajectory prediction by inferring distant trajectory endpoints to guide long-range, multi-modal predictions.22 This model hypothesizes that pedestrian trajectories are shaped by a long-term desired destination, a plan to reach sub-goals considering scene elements, and adjustments for other moving agents while respecting social norms.22 PECNet incorporates a novel self-attention based social pooling layer that generalizes previous pooling mechanisms, enabling the inference of diverse yet socially compliant trajectories.22 It also utilizes a "truncation-trick" to improve diversity and multi-modal prediction performance.22 The model is based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY.22  
**PECNet also contributes a novel reinforcement learning-based synthetic dataset**.30  
**Diffusion Models:** These models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for stochastic human trajectory prediction, capable of producing high-quality and diverse samples, making them ideal for synthetic data generation.26

* **Leapfrog Diffusion Model (LED):** LED is a novel diffusion-based model designed for real-time, precise, and diverse stochastic human trajectory prediction.32 It addresses the computational expense typically associated with diffusion models by leveraging a trainable "leapfrog initializer" that directly learns an expressive multi-modal distribution, significantly accelerating inference speed by skipping numerous denoising steps.32  
* **SingularTrajectory:** This framework proposes a diffusion-based universal trajectory predictor that unifies various human dynamics representations across multiple tasks. It achieves this by projecting different motion patterns into a "Singular space" and then employing a cascaded denoising process to refine prototype paths, generating socially-acceptable future trajectories.34  
* **Egocentric Scene-aware Human Trajectory Prediction:** This method utilizes a diffusion model to generate a distribution of potential future trajectories. It conditions these predictions on the surrounding static scene and the user's past walking trajectory, demonstrating accurate prediction of human preferences while accounting for scene context.31  
* **DiffMove:** This approach applies diffusion models in an embedding space for discrete location trajectory recovery. It effectively models transition, periodicity, and temporal patterns inherent in human mobility data, often derived from GPS-like sources such as Foursquare and Geolife datasets.34

**Other Notable Architectures:** Graph-based methods, such as GRIP++ and EvolveGraph, have been developed to explicitly model complex interactions between multiple agents, crucial for interaction-aware trajectory prediction.17 Models like Social-STGCNN and SGCN also leverage Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for spatio-temporal modeling.36 Furthermore, Transformer-based models, such as AgentFormer, are increasingly prevalent for their ability to capture long-range dependencies and interactions in multi-agent forecasting.15  
The consistent application of GANs, VAEs, and particularly Diffusion Models across both taxi and human trajectory prediction and generation underscores a significant convergence in the field. This convergence is not coincidental; it stems from the fact that these models are uniquely equipped to handle the inherent multi-modality and uncertainty that characterize real-world movements. For example, the "pooling mechanisms" in Social GAN and PECNet, and the broader concept of "interaction-aware" models, are direct responses to the challenge of interpersonal interaction. Similarly, the ability of diffusion models to "simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty" directly addresses the multi-modality challenge. This strong methodological overlap suggests that advancements in human trajectory prediction, especially in modeling complex social interactions and diverse outcomes, can directly inform and benefit taxi trajectory generation, particularly in urban settings where interactions between vehicles and pedestrians are frequent, **and are highly valuable for generating realistic synthetic data for training and simulation**.

### **4.3. Benchmark Datasets**

Robust evaluation and development of human trajectory prediction models rely heavily on standardized benchmark datasets that capture diverse real-world scenarios and interactions. These datasets are also crucial for learning the underlying distributions to generate synthetic data.

* **ETH/UCY Benchmark:** This collection of datasets has emerged as the primary reference for evaluating state-of-the-art Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) methods.21 It provides rich scenarios with diverse human-human interactions in real-world settings.21 The benchmark comprises five distinct scenes: ETH and HOTEL (from the ETH dataset), and UNIV, ZARA1, and ZARA2 (from the UCY dataset). Collectively, these datasets include trajectories of 1536 pedestrians in crowded environments, capturing challenging situations such as group behaviors, pedestrian crossings, collision avoidance, and groups forming and dispersing.2  
* **Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD):** SDD is a well-established benchmark for human trajectory prediction, offering a bird's-eye view perspective. It contains data on various agents and features over 40,000 interactions between agents and the scene, making it valuable for studying complex interaction dynamics.22  
* **NGSIM (Next Generation Simulation), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD):** While primarily developed for autonomous driving research, these datasets are also relevant for multi-agent human trajectory prediction as they include data on pedestrians and cyclists alongside vehicles.17  
* **NBA/NFL Datasets:** Beyond typical road-agent scenarios, datasets from professional sports, such as NBA and NFL, have been utilized in models like the Leapfrog Diffusion Model (LED).33 This demonstrates the broader applicability of HTP techniques to diverse domains involving complex multi-agent movements.  
* **Foursquare and Geolife Datasets:** These datasets, often used in human mobility research, contain GPS-like discrete location data, which are relevant for models like DiffMove that focus on trajectory recovery in embedding spaces.35

The prominence of datasets like ETH/UCY and SDD, specifically highlighted for their "socially interactive environments" and rich "interactions," indicates that the field places a high priority on understanding how agents influence each other's movements. For taxi trajectory generation, this emphasizes that datasets capturing interactions between taxis, other vehicles, and even pedestrians (e.g., at pickup/dropoff points or busy intersections) would be highly valuable for developing more sophisticated and realistic models. Such interaction-rich data is crucial for models to learn socially compliant and safe behaviors, and for generating high-fidelity synthetic data that reflects these complexities.

### **4.4. Standard Evaluation Metrics**

Evaluating the performance of trajectory prediction and generation models requires a set of quantitative metrics that capture various aspects of accuracy, realism, and safety. When generating synthetic data, these metrics help assess how well the generated trajectories mimic real-world patterns.

* **Average Displacement Error (ADE):** This metric quantifies the average L2 distance between the ground truth trajectory and the predicted trajectory across all predicted time steps.2 A lower ADE value indicates higher accuracy in forecasting the overall path.  
* **Final Displacement Error (FDE):** FDE measures the L2 distance specifically between the predicted final destination and the true final destination at the conclusion of the prediction period.2 A lower FDE signifies greater accuracy in predicting the ultimate stopping point or goal.  
* **Collision-free Score:** This metric assesses the feasibility and safety of generated trajectories by determining whether they intersect with impermeable objects within the environment. It counts the number of consecutive prediction steps where the trajectory successfully avoids collisions with static obstacles like ground, stairs, walls, or rough terrains.31 A higher score, ideally reaching the total number of prediction steps, indicates superior performance in generating safe paths.  
* **Smoothness:** The smoothness metric quantifies the continuity and fluidity of movement within the generated trajectories. It is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of speed and acceleration when compared to the ground truth.31 Higher smoothness scores correspond to more desirable and natural-looking trajectories, which is particularly important for passenger comfort in autonomous vehicles and for realistic human motion simulation.  
* **Best of N & Best of 1:** Recognizing the inherent multi-modality of real-world trajectories (i.e., multiple plausible futures), these metrics evaluate a model's ability to capture the distribution of potential outcomes. "Best of N" (similar to minADE-K) assesses whether the ground truth trajectory is encapsulated within a set of K generated predictions, focusing on the minimum average displacement error across these predictions. "Best of 1" complements this by evaluating the accuracy of a single, most likely prediction, allowing comparison with models that do not generate a multimodal distribution.31 These metrics ensure a balanced evaluation of both predictive capacity and versatility in capturing the range of plausible motions.

The inclusion of metrics beyond basic accuracy, such as "Collision-free Score" and "Smoothness," indicates a maturation in the field towards evaluating the *quality* and *plausibility* of generated trajectories, especially for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. The "Best of N" metric directly addresses the multi-modal output of generative models. For a master's thesis, relying solely on low ADE/FDE values may not be sufficient. A comprehensive evaluation should also consider the realism, safety, and diversity of the generated taxi trajectories, aligning with the practical needs and complexities of urban mobility systems, and ensuring the utility of synthetic data.

| Metric Name | Definition | Purpose/Significance | Typical Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ADE | Average L2 distance between ground truth and predicted trajectory over all time steps. | Measures overall prediction accuracy. | Lower is better. |
| FDE | L2 distance between predicted final destination and true final destination. | Measures accuracy of predicting the ultimate goal. | Lower is better. |

## **5\. Cross-Domain Analysis: Shared Methodologies and Insights**

### **5.1. Common Deep Learning Paradigms and Techniques**

A notable aspect of trajectory research is the significant convergence of deep learning methodologies across seemingly distinct domains like taxi and human trajectory prediction. This convergence stems from the fundamental computational challenges that are common to modeling any moving entity in a dynamic environment, particularly when dealing with GPS-derived spatio-temporal data.  
**Generative Models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models):** These models are universally adopted across both taxi and human trajectory prediction and generation tasks to effectively capture multi-modality and uncertainty.2 Their ability to learn and sample from complex data distributions makes them ideal for scenarios where multiple plausible future paths exist, including those represented by sequences of GPS points, and are crucial for synthetic data generation.  
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs:** As core architectures for sequential data, RNNs and their variants like LSTMs are widely used in both domains to model the temporal dependencies inherent in spatio-temporal trajectories, such as those found in GPS logs. They are crucial for understanding the sequence of movements over time.  
**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Increasingly, GNNs are employed to model complex interactions between multiple agents, whether they are vehicles in traffic or pedestrians in a crowd.19 GNNs excel at representing relational information and propagating features across connected entities, which is vital for understanding how agents influence each other's movements within a road network or spatial grid derived from GPS data.  
**Transformers:** These architectures have gained prominence for their powerful ability to capture long-range dependencies and complex interactions within sequences, making them suitable for modeling extended trajectories and multi-agent scenarios.15  
**Attention Mechanisms:** Often integrated into RNNs, GNNs, or Transformers, attention mechanisms allow models to selectively focus on the most relevant parts of the historical trajectory (GPS points) or the most influential neighboring agents, thereby improving the accuracy of predictions.10  
The consistent appearance of these deep learning paradigms across both taxi and human trajectory research indicates that the underlying computational problems—dealing with sequential data, modeling spatial dependencies, capturing multi-agent interactions, and representing uncertainty—are fundamentally similar, regardless of the specific agent type. This methodological convergence suggests that advancements made in one domain, particularly in modeling complex social interactions and multi-modal outcomes in human trajectory prediction, can directly inform and benefit taxi trajectory generation, especially in dense urban settings where interactions between vehicles and pedestrians are frequent. A thesis can strategically leverage this cross-domain transferability to develop more sophisticated and robust models for taxi movements, particularly when working with GPS data and aiming for synthetic data generation.

### **5.2. Addressing Multi-modality and Uncertainty Across Domains**

A central challenge consistently identified across both human and taxi trajectory prediction is the inherent multi-modality of future movements. Given a specific past context, there are often multiple plausible future trajectories an agent might take.29 This is not merely a technical hurdle but a direct reflection of real-world decision-making and environmental factors. For instance, a pedestrian might choose one of several paths to reach a destination, or a taxi driver might have multiple valid route options depending on real-time traffic or passenger preferences.  
Generative models, including GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models, have become the primary tools for addressing this challenge.2 These models are specifically designed to learn the underlying data distribution and  
**generate diverse samples from it, allowing them to represent the full spectrum of possible future paths**. Diffusion models, in particular, are noted for their exceptional ability to simulate scenarios with inherent uncertainty and generate high-quality, diverse samples. Their operational principle, which involves iteratively denoising from a simple distribution, makes them exceptionally well-suited to capture the intricate nuances of complex, multi-modal distributions, even when the input is raw GPS data.  
The recognition of multi-modality and uncertainty as intrinsic properties of trajectories has fundamentally driven the shift from deterministic prediction methods, which often yield only a single average path, to generative models. This fundamental understanding has propelled the field forward, as models that can accurately represent the range of future possibilities are far more valuable for real-world applications, **especially for creating realistic synthetic data for training and simulation**. For a thesis, it is therefore crucial to explicitly articulate how the chosen methodology handles multi-modality and uncertainty, as this is a defining characteristic of state-of-the-art approaches in the field.

### **5.3. The Role of Interaction Modeling**

Interaction modeling is a critical component for generating realistic and safe trajectories, consistently identified as a key factor influencing movements for both intelligent vehicles and pedestrians.17 This goes beyond simple collision avoidance, encompassing social norms, coordinated behaviors, and the dynamic influence agents exert on one another.  
In human trajectory prediction, understanding how individuals interact with their surroundings and other people is paramount. Human motion is highly dependent on the movements of surrounding individuals.29 Models like Social GAN and PECNet have introduced novel pooling mechanisms specifically designed to aggregate information across people and effectively model human-human interactions.2 These mechanisms allow the models to learn subtle social cues and predict socially acceptable paths, not just physically possible ones.  
Similarly, in the context of vehicle trajectories, movements are highly correlated within a traffic environment. Considering these vehicle interactions is essential for accurate motion prediction, even before a clear maneuver pattern emerges.5 For instance, a taxi's trajectory might be influenced by the braking of a car ahead, the lane change of a neighboring vehicle, or the presence of pedestrians at a crosswalk.  
The consistent emphasis on interaction across both human and vehicle domains highlights that it is a universal determinant of trajectory complexity. Whether it is a pedestrian navigating a crowded sidewalk or a taxi moving through dense urban traffic, the presence and behavior of other agents significantly shape an individual's path. This strong parallel suggests a direct opportunity for knowledge transfer: insights and techniques developed for modeling complex social interactions in human trajectory prediction can be effectively adapted and applied to taxi trajectory generation. For example, incorporating interaction awareness—with other taxis, private vehicles, public transport, or even pedestrians at pickup/dropoff points and intersections—is paramount for generating realistic, safe, and efficient trajectories for intelligent taxi systems, especially when leveraging rich GPS data that captures these interactions, and for producing high-fidelity synthetic data that accurately reflects these complex interdependencies.

## **6\. Challenges and Future Directions in Trajectory Generation**

### **6.1. Data Scarcity, Quality, and Annotation**

Despite the availability of large-scale trajectory datasets, the field continues to grapple with significant challenges related to data scarcity, quality, and the labor-intensive process of annotation. Deep learning models, which underpin state-of-the-art trajectory generation, typically demand substantial quantities of meticulously labeled training data.1 This requirement is often resource-intensive and time-consuming to fulfill, creating a persistent data bottleneck.  
**Trajectory generation, particularly the synthesis of high-fidelity data, offers a promising approach to address this issue by replacing original data with generated, privacy-free alternatives, or by augmenting limited real datasets**.  
The complexity is further compounded when converting continuous, multi-agent trajectories (such as raw GPS data) into discrete sequences, which some advanced models, such as those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), require. This conversion process can result in bloated or lossy representations, potentially compromising the fidelity of the data.9 Moreover, in specific contexts, such as urban planning for cities with limited existing data, genuine data scarcity remains a significant hurdle for developing effective trajectory models.25 This persistent data bottleneck, exacerbated by the need for complex multi-agent interactions and diverse real-world scenarios, means that even with large datasets, the specific, high-quality, and annotated data needed for certain tasks can be elusive.  
Specifically for GPS trajectory data, challenges include:

* **Data Sparsity and Noise:** GPS trajectories can be sparse (infrequent readings) or noisy (inaccurate positions due to signal drift or poor accuracy). This limits the development of data-driven map-matching methods and affects the stability of algorithms.  
* **Map-Matching:** A crucial pre-processing step for raw GPS data is map-matching, which transforms sequences of GPS points into trajectories on a road network. This process is essential for many applications, including traffic optimization and human mobility analysis. Deep learning methods like DMM (Deep reinforcement learning based Map Matching) use RNNs to infer road trajectories from cell tower sequences (analogous to GPS points), avoiding extensive shortest path computations. MapformerX, based on a diffusion model (TrajDiffuse), is another end-to-end trajectory representation learning method for offline map-matching that addresses GPS data sparsity and noise.  
* **Trajectory Recovery:** Methods are needed to reconstruct missing portions of trajectories, which is vital for maintaining data integrity and completeness.10

Future research may need to explore advanced data augmentation techniques, leverage synthetic data generation (where trajectory generation itself becomes a solution to data scarcity), or develop models that are inherently more robust to limited or noisy GPS data.

### **6.2. Computational Efficiency and Real-time Inference**

The increasing complexity of state-of-the-art deep learning models for trajectory generation often comes with a significant computational cost, posing a challenge for real-world deployment. Processing large-scale trajectory data, especially high-frequency GPS streams, with these sophisticated models can incur substantial computational expenses.20  
Diffusion models, while demonstrating powerful generative capabilities and achieving state-of-the-art performance, are particularly susceptible to this challenge. Their operation typically involves a large number of iterative denoising steps, which can make real-time inference computationally expensive and time-consuming.26 However, real-time trajectory generation is a critical requirement for autonomous systems operating in dynamic and unpredictable environments, such as self-driving taxis.6 These systems need to rapidly adapt to changing conditions and new obstacles, demanding very low-latency predictions. This creates a clear trade-off between achieving high accuracy with complex models and ensuring practical deployability. Simply maximizing theoretical performance metrics may not be sufficient if the model cannot operate within the stringent time constraints of real-world applications. Innovations like the Leapfrog Diffusion Model (LED) directly address this by significantly accelerating inference speed through techniques that skip a large number of denoising steps, demonstrating a path toward balancing model complexity with real-time performance.32 Future research will continue to focus on developing more computationally efficient architectures and inference strategies for these powerful generative models, especially for large-scale synthetic data generation.

### **6.3. Robustness and Generalizability**

A critical gap exists between the impressive performance of trajectory prediction models on benchmark datasets and their reliability in unpredictable real-world environments. Current data-driven models frequently exhibit a lack of robustness when confronted with noisy inputs (common in GPS data), adversarial attacks, or unexpected events.39 This vulnerability is particularly concerning for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and, by extension, intelligent taxi systems, where even minor inaccuracies or failures can have severe consequences.  
Furthermore, models trained on specific datasets or environments may suffer from suboptimal generalization capabilities when deployed in unseen scenarios.1 This means they may struggle to adapt to transient human behaviors, such as sudden crowd gatherings, or to novel environmental conditions not encountered during training.40 The problem of overfitting to training data further exacerbates this issue, leading to models that perform well in controlled settings but falter in the dynamic and diverse real world. This highlights that achieving high accuracy on benchmarks is not the sole objective; ensuring that models are reliable and adaptable in varied, noisy, and unconstrained real-world conditions is equally important.  
**Synthetic data generation can play a key role here by providing diverse and controlled scenarios for training and testing, thereby improving the robustness and generalizability of models**. Future research must focus on developing methods for certified robustness, advanced domain adaptation, and transfer learning techniques to bridge this gap and enhance the real-world applicability of taxi trajectory generation models, especially when dealing with the inherent variability of GPS data.

### **6.4. Emerging Trends: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models**

The field of trajectory generation is on the cusp of a significant paradigm shift with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the concept of foundation models.  
**Large Language Models (LLMs):** There is a growing interest in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction, leveraging the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.9 LLMs have the potential to fundamentally reshape how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories by moving beyond purely spatio-temporal coordinates (like raw GPS) to incorporate high-level contextual information. For example, an LLM could provide semantic instructions ("generate a route to the airport during rush hour, avoiding tolls") or offer contextual reasoning that influences trajectory generation. However, this integration presents several challenges, including:

* **Tokenization and Representation:** Converting continuous, multi-agent trajectories (e.g., GPS sequences) into discrete sequences suitable for LLM processing without incurring bloated or lossy representations remains a foundational challenge.9  
* **Prompt Design and Alignment:** Effectively guiding LLMs to perform trajectory-related tasks requires carefully crafted prompts that encode scene semantics, agent states, and prediction objectives, which is often task-specific and challenging.9  
* **Reasoning Coherence:** While LLMs offer opportunities for embedding commonsense and causal reasoning, their reasoning quality in spatial and temporal domains is still limited, sometimes leading to physically implausible outcomes.9  
* **Multimodal Context Integration:** Tightly coupling visual perception, map topology, and language instructions for comprehensive trajectory forecasting is difficult due to modality mismatches and context window limitations in current LLMs.9

**Foundation Models:** The concept of "foundation models" is also gaining traction, aiming to create universal, pre-trained models for trajectory computing. TrajFM, for instance, is proposed as a vehicle trajectory foundation model designed to excel in both region and task transferability.15 It integrates spatial, temporal, and Point of Interest (POI) modalities of trajectories and includes a learnable spatio-temporal Rotary position embedding module for handling spatial features across regions. This approach suggests a move towards a single, comprehensive model that can be applied to diverse downstream tasks (e.g., prediction, demand forecasting, route recommendation,  
**and synthetic data generation**) across different geographical areas with minimal retraining.15  
This represents a cutting-edge area for a master's thesis. Exploring how LLMs can provide high-level intent or context for taxi trajectory generation, or developing a foundation model for urban mobility that can generalize across different cities and tasks, could yield highly novel and impactful contributions to the field, especially when trained on large-scale GPS datasets like the Beijing taxi data and applied to synthetic data generation.

### **6.5. Transferability Across Different Agents and Environments**

A significant aspiration in trajectory research is the development of models that exhibit strong transferability, meaning they can effectively operate across different regions, tasks, and even agent types without requiring extensive retraining. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer between various geographical regions and diverse downstream tasks, such as prediction, recommendation, or demand forecasting, without the need for complete retraining.15  
This pursuit of transferability is driven by several compelling benefits. Firstly, it substantially improves computational efficiency by allowing a single, universal model to be deployed in various scenarios, eliminating the need to train and store multiple task- or region-specific instances.15 Secondly, it enhances effectiveness, particularly in situations with limited training data for a new region or task, as the pre-trained foundation model can leverage knowledge acquired from broader datasets.15 This aligns with the broader artificial intelligence objective of achieving generalizability, moving beyond highly specialized models to more adaptable and versatile AI systems.  
For a thesis, investigating how models trained on, for example, human trajectory data in a crowded pedestrian area could be adapted or fine-tuned for taxi trajectories in a dense urban environment presents a compelling research direction. Similarly, exploring how a model trained on taxi data from one major city (like the Beijing taxi GPS dataset) could be efficiently transferred and applied to another city with minimal effort would be a valuable contribution. This focus on transferability is crucial for developing scalable and practical AI solutions for complex urban mobility challenges, **and for enabling the generation of synthetic data that is transferable across different contexts**.

## **7\. Conclusion and Recommendations for Master's Thesis**

### **7.1. Summary of Key State-of-the-Art Methods and Trends**

The landscape of trajectory generation and prediction has undergone a profound transformation, moving decisively from traditional, rule-based methods to sophisticated deep learning paradigms. **The core focus has shifted towards generating high-fidelity synthetic data for training and simulation.** Generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), and particularly Diffusion Models, have emerged as dominant approaches. Their preeminence stems from their inherent capability to capture the multi-modality and uncertainty that define real-world trajectories, allowing for the generation of diverse and plausible future paths. This is a significant advancement over deterministic models that typically provide only a single, average prediction. These models are highly suitable for processing and generating trajectories from GPS data.  
Furthermore, the importance of interaction modeling, whether between vehicles in traffic or humans in a crowd, has become a central focus. Models incorporating Graph Neural Networks and advanced pooling mechanisms are crucial for understanding and predicting movements in dynamic, multi-agent environments. The consistent application of these advanced deep learning techniques across both taxi and human trajectory domains highlights a fundamental convergence driven by shared underlying challenges related to sequential data, spatial dependencies, and complex interactions. Datasets like Beijing Taxi (TaxiBJ), Porto Taxi, NYC Taxi, ETH/UCY, and Stanford Drone Dataset serve as critical benchmarks, while evaluation metrics have evolved beyond simple accuracy (ADE, FDE) to encompass realism, safety, and multi-modal performance (Collision-free Score, Smoothness, Best of N). The challenges of GPS data sparsity, noise, and the need for robust map-matching and trajectory recovery methods are also key considerations for generating realistic synthetic data.

### **7.2. Potential Avenues for Further Research**

Building upon the current state-of-the-art and identified challenges, several promising avenues exist for further research in taxi trajectory generation, particularly suitable for a master's thesis leveraging your Beijing taxi GPS dataset, with a strong emphasis on synthetic data generation:

* **Road Network-Constrained Synthetic Trajectory Generation for Beijing:** Given that your dataset is GPS-based, a significant contribution could involve developing or adapting a diffusion-based model (like Diff-RNTraj) to generate synthetic taxi trajectories that are explicitly constrained to the Beijing road network. This would involve handling the hybrid nature of GPS data (continuous coordinates) and road network information (discrete segments) to produce highly realistic and usable synthetic trajectories for urban planning, traffic management simulations, and data augmentation in Beijing.  
* **High-Fidelity Synthetic Taxi Trajectory Synthesis from Noisy Beijing GPS Data:** Focus on applying state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., diffusion models like DiffTraj or TrajGDM 24) to synthesize diverse and high-fidelity taxi trajectories for Beijing. This research would specifically address how to learn robust distributions from potentially noisy and sparse real-world Beijing taxi GPS data to generate synthetic data that retains geo-distribution and statistical properties, while also addressing privacy concerns.  
* **Improving Robustness of Models via Synthetic Data Augmentation for Beijing Taxis:** Investigate how synthetically generated taxi trajectories, derived from your Beijing GPS dataset, can be used to augment real training data. The goal would be to improve the robustness and generalizability of downstream models (e.g., for demand prediction or route recommendation) when faced with noisy GPS inputs or out-of-distribution scenarios in Beijing's urban environment. This could involve generating "hard" synthetic examples to challenge models.  
* **Interaction-Aware Synthetic Taxi Trajectory Generation in Beijing's Urban Environment:** Develop generative models that explicitly account for complex interactions between taxis and other road users (private vehicles, buses, pedestrians) in Beijing's dense urban environment. The objective would be to synthesize realistic interaction scenarios, which are often difficult to capture comprehensively in real datasets, for use in traffic simulations or for training autonomous driving systems.  
* **Transferable Synthetic Mobility Generation using Beijing Taxi Data as a Foundation:** Explore how a generative model trained on the extensive Beijing taxi GPS dataset could serve as a "foundation model" for generating synthetic taxi trajectories in other Chinese cities with less available data. This would contribute to developing more generalizable and scalable urban mobility solutions by demonstrating the transferability of learned mobility patterns for synthetic data generation.  
* **Semantic-Guided Synthetic Taxi Trajectory Generation for Beijing:** Leverage the meteorological data and potential Points of Interest (POIs) in Beijing to enable semantic-guided synthetic trajectory generation. This could involve developing models that can generate trajectories based on high-level semantic instructions (e.g., "generate trajectories during a heavy rain event," or "routes to popular tourist spots during peak hours") to produce more contextually aware and intelligent synthetic taxi data for specific simulation needs.
