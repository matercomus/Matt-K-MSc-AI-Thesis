## **üìö Theoretical Foundation & Literature Support**

### **1. Diffusion Models for Trajectory Synthesis**

The foundation of this approach rests on **DiffTraj**, a spatial-temporal diffusion probabilistic model that has demonstrated superior performance in generating high-fidelity GPS trajectories¬π. Unlike traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), DiffTraj directly explores spatial and temporal distributions without requiring additional data manipulation, contributing to superior quality¬π.

> **"DiffTraj exhibits the capability to generate high-fidelity trajectories that accurately retain the original data distributions while being inherently privacy-preserving through its noise-based reconstruction process"** ¬π

### **2. Anomaly Generation Through Controlled Synthesis**

Recent research has established that **Diffusion Models can generate realistic anomalous samples by interpolating between normal and abnormal data distributions**‚Åπ. This paradigm shift from passive anomaly detection to active anomaly synthesis represents a significant advancement in the field‚Å∑.

The concept of "controlled anomaly injection" is emerging as a critical theme in anomaly detection research, enabling the **strategic move from passive analysis to active data generation for enhancing AD system performance**‚Å∑.

### **3. Latent Space Manipulation for Fine-Grained Control**

Diffusion models learn complex data distributions and compress them into lower-dimensional latent spaces that preserve essential features¬≤‚Åπ. **Manipulating specific dimensions within this latent space allows for fine-grained control over generative aspects**¬≤‚Åπ, enabling targeted anomaly creation.

### **4. Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation**

GPS trajectories inherently contain sensitive personal geolocation information, creating serious privacy concerns including potential re-identification¬π. **Diffusion models offer inherent privacy advantages through their generative process of reconstructing from noise rather than replicating originals**¬π, providing a practical privacy baseline.
