## Data Source

The dataset used in this study consisted of Beijing taxi GPS data collected between 25.11.2019 and 01.12.2019.

## Basic Statistics

Each day contained approximately 16GB of raw GPS data, capturing the detailed movements of taxis throughout the metropolitan area. This large-scale dataset provided a rich source of real-world taxi routes for analysis and synthetic data generation.
