\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This thesis addresses a fundamental challenge in urban trajectory prediction: how to achieve transformer-level spatial reasoning while maintaining millisecond-scale inference speeds required for real-time traffic management. Through training-time knowledge distillation, we transfer spatial understanding from LM-TAD (a trajectory anomaly detection model) to HOSER (a fast zone-based prediction model), demonstrating that cross-task knowledge transfer can dramatically improve route prediction without inference-time overhead.

\subsection{Summary of Contributions}
\label{sec:conclusion-contributions}

We make four primary contributions to trajectory prediction research:

\textbf{1. First Cross-Task Distillation Framework.} We propose the first knowledge distillation framework that transfers spatial reasoning from trajectory \emph{anomaly detection} to trajectory \emph{prediction}. This cross-task paradigm demonstrates that ``normal trajectory'' knowledge learned by anomaly detectors provides valuable priors for route prediction, opening a new direction for model combination in mobility research.

\textbf{2. Dramatic Performance Improvements.} On the Beijing dataset with 40,060 roads and 629,380 training trajectories, our distilled models achieve:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{85--89\% path completion success} vs. vanilla's 12--18\% (47--74$\times$ improvement)
    \item \textbf{87\% better distance distribution matching} (JSD: 0.016--0.022 vs 0.145--0.153)
    \item \textbf{98\% better spatial pattern fidelity} (radius JSD: 0.003--0.004 vs 0.198--0.206)
    \item \textbf{Realistic trip lengths} (6.4 km vs vanilla's 2.4 km, real: 5.2 km)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Optimal Hyperparameter Discovery.} Systematic Optuna-based tuning reveals that \emph{minimal distillation weight} ($\lambda = 0.0014$) with \emph{high temperature} ($\tau = 4.37$) enables effective knowledge transfer. This counter-intuitive result suggests subtle distributional guidance is more effective than aggressive knowledge transfer, allowing students to integrate teacher knowledge while preserving their architectural strengths.

\textbf{4. Reproducible Evaluation Framework.} We release a comprehensive evaluation pipeline covering global distribution metrics (JSD), local trajectory similarity (Hausdorff, DTW, EDR), and path completion assessment. The framework separately evaluates memorization (train OD pairs) and generalization (test OD pairs), revealing distilled models' surprising ability to \emph{generalize better than they memorize}â€”test JSD lower than train JSD.

\subsection{Key Findings}
\label{sec:conclusion-findings}

Our experiments reveal several important insights about knowledge distillation for trajectory prediction:

\textbf{Knowledge Distillation Transfers Spatial Understanding.} The dramatic improvements in path completion (85--89\% vs 12--18\%) and distribution quality (87--98\% JSD reduction) demonstrate that distillation transfers \emph{fundamental spatial reasoning}, not merely improved metrics. Vanilla HOSER systematically generates unrealistically short trips (2.4 km) and fails to reach destinations, while distilled models navigate successfully and produce realistic-length routes.

\textbf{Minimal Guidance with Broad Knowledge Works Best.} The optimal configuration uses very low distillation weight ($\lambda = 0.0014$) but high temperature ($\tau = 4.37$), suggesting that subtle, broadly distributed teacher guidance is more effective than strong, focused knowledge transfer. This allows the student to maintain its fast inference characteristics while integrating spatial priors.

\textbf{Distillation Enables True Generalization.} Distilled models perform \emph{better on test OD pairs than training OD pairs} (lower JSD), indicating they learned generalizable spatial patterns rather than memorizing training routes. This counter-intuitive result suggests the teacher's distributional knowledge helps students abstract beyond specific trajectory examples.

\textbf{Vanilla HOSER Has Fundamental Spatial Limitations.} Without distillation, HOSER suffers from severe spatial reasoning deficits: (i) 82--88\% path completion failure, (ii) 55\% underestimation of trip lengths, and (iii) 50--70$\times$ worse spatial complexity modeling. These are not merely quantitative differences but fundamental failures that prevent practical deployment.

\textbf{Knowledge Transfer Is Robust.} Cross-seed evaluation (seeds 42, 44) shows coefficient of variation below 15\% for all metrics, confirming distillation reliably transfers knowledge regardless of initialization. The consistency across random seeds validates the framework's stability for production use.

\subsection{Practical Impact}
\label{sec:conclusion-impact}

The resulting system enables several practical applications for urban traffic management and intelligent transportation:

\textbf{Real-Time Traffic Management.} Fast inference speeds ($\sim$13 ms/batch, $\sim$77 trajectories/second) combined with accurate route prediction support real-time traffic signal optimization, dynamic routing, and congestion management at city scale.

\textbf{Infrastructure Planning and Policy Decisions.} High-quality trajectory generation enables traffic regulators to simulate infrastructure changes (new roads, lane additions, traffic calming) and predict their impact on mobility patterns before costly construction.

\textbf{Urban Digital Twins.} Realistic trajectory synthesis supports digital twin platforms that mirror real city dynamics, enabling what-if analysis for urban planning, emergency response simulation, and long-term development strategies.

\textbf{Agent-Based Traffic Simulation.} Generated trajectories can populate large-scale agent-based simulations with diverse, realistic mobility patterns, supporting research in autonomous vehicles, shared mobility, and transportation network optimization.

\textbf{Model Evaluation and Testing.} The framework generates high-fidelity synthetic trajectories that can be used to evaluate and test other trajectory-based models (e.g., travel time estimators, destination predictors, routing systems) with realistic mobility patterns.

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:conclusion-limitations}

Despite promising results, several limitations warrant acknowledgment:

\textbf{Limited Dataset Evaluation.} We present complete results only for Beijing. Porto evaluation is in progress, and BJUT evaluation is planned. Comprehensive cross-dataset validation is needed to confirm generalization across urban environments with different characteristics (network topology, trajectory lengths, mobility patterns).

\textbf{Inference Speed Not Formally Benchmarked.} While fast inference is a core motivation ($\sim$13 ms/batch claimed), we have not conducted systematic latency benchmarking under controlled conditions. Formal validation comparing vanilla vs distilled inference speeds, batch size sensitivity, and hardware-specific performance is needed.

\textbf{Limited Ablation Studies.} We lack comprehensive ablation studies for key design choices:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Distillation weight sensitivity ($\lambda$ from 0 to 1)
    \item Learning rate influence (noted as impactful but not systematically studied)
    \item Temperature sensitivity beyond Optuna's explored range
    \item Alternative teacher models or multi-teacher configurations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Single Teacher-Student Pair.} We evaluate only LM-TAD $\rightarrow$ HOSER distillation. Whether the benefits generalize to other teacher-student combinations (e.g., other anomaly detectors, different prediction models) remains unknown.

\textbf{Architectural Constraints.} HOSER's hierarchical zone-based architecture may limit applicability to other trajectory prediction models with different architectural paradigms (pure transformers, diffusion models, etc.). The framework requires vocabulary alignment mechanisms specific to each architecture.

\textbf{Evaluation Limitations.} The OD pair matching metric (grid-based, 111m resolution) may be sensitive to grid size choice. Alternative evaluation protocols (e.g., corridor-based matching, semantic location matching) could provide complementary perspectives on path completion quality.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion-future}

Several promising directions extend this research:

\subsubsection{Extended Dataset Evaluation}

\textbf{Complete Porto and BJUT Evaluation.} Finish Porto experiments (currently running) and conduct full BJUT evaluation to validate cross-dataset generalization. Compare distillation effectiveness across cities with different characteristics.

\textbf{Additional Urban Networks.} Evaluate on diverse cities (Chengdu, Xi'an, San Francisco, London) covering varied network topologies (grid vs organic street patterns), scales (dense metropolitan vs sprawling suburban), and mobility patterns (taxi-dominated vs mixed-mode transportation).

\textbf{Cross-Dataset Transfer.} Investigate whether a teacher trained on Beijing can distill effectively for Porto students, enabling knowledge transfer across cities without retraining teachers for each location.

\subsubsection{Systematic Ablation Studies}

\textbf{Distillation Weight Sensitivity.} Conduct $\lambda$ ablation from 0 to 1 to understand the full influence curve. Particular focus on: (i) why minimal $\lambda = 0.0014$ is optimal, (ii) whether $\lambda = 1.0$ (pure distillation) completely fails, and (iii) the shape of the performance vs $\lambda$ relationship.

\textbf{Learning Rate Analysis.} Systematically evaluate learning rates from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$ with fixed distillation parameters. Hypothesis: lower learning rates may enable finer-grained teacher knowledge integration.

\textbf{Temperature Characterization.} Evaluate $\tau \in [1, 10]$ to map the temperature-performance relationship. Expected: very low $\tau$ provides minimal smoothing (limited dark knowledge), very high $\tau$ over-smooths and loses discriminative information.

\subsubsection{Inference Speed Validation}

\textbf{Formal Benchmarking.} Conduct systematic latency measurements comparing:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Vanilla vs distilled HOSER (should be identicalâ€”validate this claim)
    \item HOSER vs LM-TAD teacher (expected $\sim$33$\times$ speedup)
    \item Batch size sensitivity and optimal batch configuration
    \item Hardware-specific performance (different GPUs, CPU-only inference)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Production Deployment Profiling.} Characterize end-to-end latency including data loading, candidate generation, model inference, and post-processing. Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities for real-time deployment.

\subsubsection{Extended Distillation Framework}

\textbf{Alternative Teacher Models.} Explore distillation from other spatial knowledge sources:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Large trajectory foundation models~\cite{maLearningUniversalHuman2025}
    \item Graph neural networks with rich spatial embeddings
    \item Diffusion-based trajectory generators~\cite{chuSimulatingHumanMobility2024}
    \item Ensemble teachers combining multiple models
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-Teacher Distillation.} Investigate whether combining knowledge from multiple teachers (e.g., anomaly detector + foundation model) provides complementary benefits. Develop strategies for weighting and integrating diverse teacher signals.

\textbf{Task-Specific Distillation.} Explore whether distillation can transfer other capabilities beyond spatial reasoning: temporal patterns, route diversity, multi-modal behavior, destination prediction.

\textbf{Progressive Distillation.} Investigate staged knowledge transfer: first distill basic spatial understanding, then refine with trajectory-specific knowledge, potentially improving convergence and final performance.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Understanding}

\textbf{Why Does Minimal $\lambda$ Work Best?} Develop theoretical framework explaining why subtle teacher guidance ($\lambda = 0.0014$) outperforms stronger knowledge transfer. Connection to regularization, implicit bias, and student capacity constraints.

\textbf{Temperature-Knowledge Relationship.} Formalize the relationship between temperature, dark knowledge extraction, and student learning dynamics. When does high temperature help vs harm knowledge transfer?

\textbf{Cross-Task Transfer Analysis.} Characterize what makes anomaly detection knowledge useful for prediction. Can we predict \emph{a priori} which task combinations will yield successful distillation?

\subsubsection{Application Extensions}

\textbf{Real-Time System Integration.} Deploy distilled models in operational traffic management systems, evaluate performance under production constraints, and gather feedback from traffic regulators on practical utility.

\textbf{Federated Distillation.} Explore privacy-preserving distillation where teachers are trained on sensitive data (real trajectories) but students learn only distributional knowledge, enabling deployment without raw data exposure.

\textbf{Online Adaptation.} Investigate whether distilled models can adapt to changing traffic patterns (construction, events, seasonal variations) through online learning while maintaining spatial consistency from teacher knowledge.

\textbf{Multi-Modal Trajectory Synthesis.} Extend to other transportation modes (walking, cycling, public transit) and multi-modal journeys, enabling comprehensive urban mobility modeling.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion-remarks}

This thesis demonstrates that training-time knowledge distillation enables lightweight trajectory prediction models to achieve transformer-level spatial reasoning without inference-time computational overhead. The dramatic improvements in path completion success (47--74$\times$), distribution quality (87--98\% JSD reduction), and spatial pattern fidelity validate cross-task knowledge transfer as a powerful paradigm for trajectory prediction.

The finding that \emph{minimal distillation weight with high temperature} works best challenges conventional distillation wisdom and suggests fundamental insights about how students integrate teacher knowledge. The distilled models' ability to \emph{generalize better than they memorize} further demonstrates that distributional guidance helps students abstract beyond specific training examples.

These results have immediate practical implications for urban traffic management, enabling policy makers and traffic regulators to deploy AI-based route prediction systems that balance accuracy and efficiency. The framework supports critical applications including real-time traffic signal optimization, infrastructure planning, urban digital twins, and high-quality synthetic data generationâ€”all requiring fast, accurate trajectory prediction at metropolitan scale.

Looking forward, the cross-task distillation paradigm opens new research directions in trajectory modeling. By combining the strengths of different model families (transformers for spatial reasoning, lightweight models for speed), distillation enables practical deployment of sophisticated AI systems in real-world urban transportation. As cities worldwide invest in intelligent transportation infrastructure and digital twin platforms, techniques like knowledge distillation will prove essential for bridging the gap between research-quality models and production-ready systems.

The journey from transformer-based anomaly detection to fast, distilled route prediction illustrates a broader principle: \emph{architectural diversity is a resource, not an obstacle}. Different models excel at different aspects of trajectory modeling. Knowledge distillation allows us to combine these strengths, creating systems that are greater than the sum of their parts. This synthesisâ€”bringing together spatial understanding, computational efficiency, and cross-task transferâ€”represents a promising path toward truly intelligent urban transportation systems.
