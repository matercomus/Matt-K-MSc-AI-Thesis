# Thesis Full Text Review Workflow

## Build and Convert Script

Use [build-and-convert.sh](mdc:build-and-convert.sh) to get the complete thesis in text format.

### When to Use

**Always use this script before:**
- Performing operations that span multiple sections
- Identifying duplicates or redundancies across the document
- Checking consistency of terminology, notation, or claims
- Verifying cross-references between sections
- Searching for specific content across the entire thesis
- Assessing overall document structure and flow

### Usage

```bash
./build-and-convert.sh
```

This script:
1. Builds the LaTeX thesis with `latexmk -pdf -g`
2. Converts the PDF to text with `pdftotext -layout`
3. Outputs to `build/main.txt`

### Workflow Pattern

```
1. Run ./build-and-convert.sh
2. Read build/main.txt (full thesis in text form)
3. Perform cross-section analysis
4. Make necessary changes to source files
5. Rebuild to verify
```

### Why Text Format?

The text version (`build/main.txt`) is ideal for:
- Reading large sections of content efficiently
- Searching for patterns and duplicates
- Analyzing document structure without LaTeX markup
- Quick full-document scans (~2000 lines vs ~7000 PDF lines)

### Example Operations Requiring Full Text

**Cross-section duplicate detection:**
```bash
./build-and-convert.sh
# Then read build/main.txt to identify duplicates across sections
```

**Terminology consistency check:**
```bash
./build-and-convert.sh
grep -i "specific term" build/main.txt
```

**Section flow verification:**
```bash
./build-and-convert.sh
# Read build/main.txt to assess narrative flow
```

## Key Principle

**Don't assume section independence.** When working on one section, be aware that content may be duplicated, referenced, or contradicted in other sections. Use the full text version to maintain consistency across the entire thesis.
