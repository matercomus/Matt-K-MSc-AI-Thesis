# Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Trajectory Generation for Taxi Route Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my Master's thesis in Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

## Research Overview

This thesis addresses the challenge of generating synthetic taxi trajectory datasets that preserve essential characteristics for anomaly detection research while ensuring passenger privacy protection. The proposed framework integrates DiffTraj-based synthetic generation with LM-TAD anomaly detection to enable privacy-preserving research in urban transportation systems.

## Compilation

The project uses **LuaLaTeX** for compilation via `latexmk`, with build artifacts directed to the `build/` directory.

### Prerequisites

- TeX Live or MiKTeX distribution (with LuaTeX support)
- LaTeX Workshop extension (for VS Code/Cursor)
- ChkTeX (for linting)
- latexindent (for formatting)
- `texlive-emoji` package (for emoji support)

See `notes/SETUP.md` for detailed installation instructions.

### Building the Document

**Using LaTeX Workshop (VS Code/Cursor):**
- Press `Ctrl+Alt+B` to build
- Build artifacts will be placed in `build/` directory
- The configuration uses LuaLaTeX by default (see `.vscode/settings.json`)

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

The compiled PDF will be generated as `build/main.pdf`.

**Note:** This project requires **LuaLaTeX** (not pdfLaTeX) for:
- Native UTF-8 support via `fontspec` package
- Color emoji rendering in figures (🔥❄️)
- Modern font handling

The `.latexmkrc` configuration automatically uses LuaLaTeX when building.

## Bibliography Management

References are managed through **Zotero** using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. The `references_new.bib` file is exported from Zotero and should not be manually edited.

To update citations:
1. Add/modify references in Zotero
2. Export updated bibliography to `references_new.bib`
3. Rebuild the document

## Development Workflow

### Linting and Formatting

The repository includes configuration files for code quality:
- `.chktexrc` - ChkTeX linting rules
- `.latexindent.yaml` - Code formatting preferences
- `.latexmkrc` - Build automation configuration

### Git Workflow

This project follows conventional commit conventions with gitmojis. See `.cursor/rules/git-best-practices.mdc` for details.

## Project Status

**Current Stage:** Writing and methodology development  
**Target Completion:** June 2025  
**Institution:** Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
