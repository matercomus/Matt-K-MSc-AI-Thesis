abstract = {Vehicle trajectory anomaly detection plays an essential role in the fields of traffic video surveillance, autonomous driving navigation, and taxi fraud detection. Deep generative models have been shown to be promising solutions for anomaly detection, avoiding the costs involved in manual labeling. However, existing popular generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) are often plagued by training instability, mode collapse, and poor sample quality. To resolve the dilemma, we present DiffTAD, a novel vehicle trajectory anomaly detection framework based on the emerging diffusion models. DiffTAD formalizes anomaly detection as a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the vehicle trajectory until the path is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The core idea of our framework is to devise deep neural networks to learn the reverse of the diffusion process and to detect anomalies by comparing the difference between a query trajectory and its reconstruction. DiffTAD is a parameterized Markov chain trained with variational inference and allows the mean square error to optimize the reweighted variational lower bound. In addition, DiffTAD integrates decoupled Transformer-based temporal and spatial encoders to model the temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among vehicles in the diffusion models. Experiments on the real-world trajectory dataset TRAFFIC demonstrate that our DiffTAD achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with the maximum enhancements reaching 25.87% and 35.59% in terms of AUC and F1. While on the synthetic datasets CROSS, SynTra, and MAAD, the maximum improvements in AUC/F1 are 27.47%/38.56%, 25.38%/31.42%, and 58.22%/50.04%, respectively.}

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design, analysis, implementation, and operational deployment of a real-time trip information system that provides passengers with the expected fare and trip duration of the taxi ride they are planning to take. This system was built in cooperation with a taxi operator that operates more than 15,000 taxis in Singapore. We first describe the overall system design and then explain the efficient algorithms used to achieve our predictions based on up to 21 months of historical data consisting of approximately 250 million paid taxi trips. We then describe various optimisations (involving region sizes, amount of history, and data mining techniques) and accuracy analysis (involving routes and weather) we performed to increase both the runtime performance and prediction accuracy. Our large scale evaluation demonstrates that our system is (a) accurate --- with the mean fare error under 1 Singapore dollar (~ 0.76 US$) and the mean duration error under three minutes, and (b) capable of real-time performance, processing thousands to millions of queries per second. Finally, we describe the lessons learned during the process of deploying this system into a production environment.},

abstract = {The advances in location-acquisition and mobile computing techniques have generated massive spatial trajectory data, which represent the mobility of a diversity of moving objects, such as people, vehicles, and animals. Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community.},
