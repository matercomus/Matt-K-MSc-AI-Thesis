  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to introduce new design-criteria for next-generation hyperparameter optimization software. The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to light-weight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

  abstract = {Tabular data is among the oldest and most ubiquitous forms of data. However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data's characteristics remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes.},

  abstract = {Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment {\textbackslash}textbf\{P\}erception and explicit {\textbackslash}textbf\{R\}oute choice modeling for effective {\textbackslash}textbf\{Traj\}ectory representation learning, dubbed {\textbackslash}textbf\{PRTraj\}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.},

  abstract = {Trajectory computing is a pivotal domain encompassing trajectory data management and mining, garnering widespread attention due to its crucial role in various practical applications such as location services, urban traffic, and public safety. Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Notably, we encapsulate recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that hold the potential to augment trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in DL4Traj research and propose future directions.

  abstract = {Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

Studies have shown that synthetic data can effectively improve the performance of LLMs on downstream benchmarks. However, despite its potential benefits, our analysis suggests that there may be inherent flaws in synthetic data. The uniform format of synthetic data can lead to pattern overfitting and cause significant shifts in the output distribution, thereby reducing the model's instruction-following capabilities. Our work delves into these specific flaws associated with question-answer (Q-A) pairs, a prevalent type of synthetic data, and presents a method based on unlearning techniques to mitigate these flaws. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which can reverse the instruction-following issues caused by pattern overfitting without compromising performance on benchmarks at relatively low cost. Our work has yielded key insights into the effective use of synthetic data, aiming to promote more robust and efficient LLM training.},

  abstract = {Synthetic data generation is a fundamental task for many data management and data science applications. Spatial data is of particular interest, and its sensitive nature often leads to privacy concerns. We introduce GeoPointGAN, a novel GAN-based solution for generating synthetic spatial point datasets with high utility and strong individual level privacy guarantees. GeoPointGAN's architecture includes a novel point transformation generator that learns to project randomly generated point co-ordinates into meaningful synthetic co-ordinates that capture both microscopic (e.g., junctions, squares) and macroscopic (e.g., parks, lakes) geographic features. We provide our privacy guarantees through label local differential privacy, which is more practical than traditional local differential privacy. We seamlessly integrate this level of privacy into GeoPointGAN by augmenting the discriminator to the point level and implementing a randomized response-based mechanism that flips the labels associated with the `real' and `fake' points used in training. Extensive experiments show that GeoPointGAN significantly outperforms recent solutions, improving by up to 10 times compared to the most competitive baseline. We also evaluate GeoPointGAN using range, hotspot, and facility location queries, which confirm the practical effectiveness of GeoPointGAN for privacy-preserving querying. The results illustrate that a strong level of privacy is achieved with little-to-no adverse utility cost, which we explain through the generalization and regularization effects that are realized by flipping the labels of the data during training.},

  abstract = {Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose {\textbackslash}textit\{TrajAgent\}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In {\textbackslash}textit\{TrajAgent\}, we first develop {\textbackslash}textit\{UniEnv\}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on {\textbackslash}textit\{UniEnv\}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of {\textbackslash}textit\{TrajAgent\} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38{\textbackslash}\%-34.96{\textbackslash}\% over baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Location and trajectory data are routinely collected to generate valuable knowledge about users' pattern behavior. However, releasing location data may jeopardize the privacy of the involved individuals. Differential privacy is a powerful technique that prevents an adversary from inferring the presence or absence of an individual in the original data solely based on the observed data. The first challenge in applying differential privacy in location is that a it usually involves a single user. This shifts the adversary's target to the user's locations instead of presence or absence in the original data. The second challenge is that the inherent correlation between location data, due to people's movement regularity and predictability, gives the adversary an advantage in inferring information about individuals. In this paper, we review the differentially private approaches to tackle these challenges. Our goal is to help newcomers to the field to better understand the state-of-the art by providing a research map that highlights the different challenges in designing differentially private frameworks that tackle the characteristics of location data. We find that in protecting an individual's location privacy, the attention of differential privacy mechanisms shifts to preventing the adversary from inferring the original location based on the observed one. Moreover, we find that the privacy-preserving mechanisms make use of the predictability and regularity of users' movements to design and protect the users' privacy in trajectory data. Finally, we explore how well the presented frameworks succeed in protecting users' locations and trajectories against well-known privacy attacks.},

  abstract = {Class imbalance is a common issue while developing classification models. In order to tackle this problem, synthetic data have recently been developed to enhance the minority class. These artificially generated samples aim to bolster the representation of the minority class. However, evaluating the suitability of such generated data is crucial to ensure their alignment with the original data distribution. Utility measures come into play here to quantify how similar the distribution of the generated data is to the original one. For tabular data, there are various evaluation methods that assess different characteristics of the generated data. In this study, we collected utility measures and categorized them based on the type of analysis they performed. We then applied these measures to synthetic data generated from two well-known datasets, Adults Income, and Liar+. We also used five well-known generative models, Borderline SMOTE, DataSynthesizer, CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and REaLTabFormer, to generate the synthetic data and evaluated its quality using the utility measures. The measurements have proven to be informative, indicating that if one synthetic dataset is superior to another in terms of utility measures, it will be more effective as an augmentation for the minority class when performing classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Next location prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, due to the limitation of existing deep learning methods, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to zero-shot next location prediction task. However, they directly generate the final output using LLMs without systematic design, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized next location prediction. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task and design specific modules to complete them, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments utilizing mobility data from two distinct sources reveal that AgentMove surpasses the leading baseline by 3.33\% to 8.57\% across 8 out of 12 metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

  abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain widespread use, establishing systematic and reliable evaluation methodologies for LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) has become essential to ensure their real-world effectiveness and reliability. There have been some early explorations about the usability of LLMs for limited urban tasks, but a systematic and scalable evaluation benchmark is still lacking. The challenge in constructing a systematic evaluation benchmark for urban research lies in the diversity of urban data, the complexity of application scenarios and the highly dynamic nature of the urban environment. In this paper, we design {\textbackslash}textit\{CityBench\}, an interactive simulator based evaluation platform, as the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs for diverse tasks in urban research. First, we build {\textbackslash}textit\{CityData\} to integrate the diverse urban data and {\textbackslash}textit\{CitySimu\} to simulate fine-grained urban dynamics. Based on {\textbackslash}textit\{CityData\} and {\textbackslash}textit\{CitySimu\}, we design 8 representative urban tasks in 2 categories of perception-understanding and decision-making as the {\textbackslash}textit\{CityBench\}. With extensive results from 30 well-known LLMs and VLMs in 13 cities around the world, we find that advanced LLMs and VLMs can achieve competitive performance in diverse urban tasks requiring commonsense and semantic understanding abilities, e.g., understanding the human dynamics and semantic inference of urban images. Meanwhile, they fail to solve the challenging urban tasks requiring professional knowledge and high-level numerical abilities, e.g., geospatial prediction and traffic control task.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of generative models, combined with pretraining on web-scale data, raises a timely question: what happens when these models are trained on their own generated outputs? Recent investigations into model-data feedback loops proposed that such loops would lead to a phenomenon termed model collapse, under which performance progressively degrades with each model-data feedback iteration until fitted models become useless. However, those studies largely assumed that new data replace old data over time, where an arguably more realistic assumption is that data accumulate over time. In this paper, we ask: what effect does accumulating data have on model collapse? We empirically study this question by pretraining sequences of language models on text corpora. We confirm that replacing the original real data by each generation's synthetic data does indeed tend towards model collapse, then demonstrate that accumulating the successive generations of synthetic data alongside the original real data avoids model collapse; these results hold across a range of model sizes, architectures, and hyperparameters. We obtain similar results for deep generative models on other types of real data: diffusion models for molecule conformation generation and variational autoencoders for image generation. To understand why accumulating data can avoid model collapse, we use an analytically tractable framework introduced by prior work in which a sequence of linear models are fit to the previous models' outputs. Previous work used this framework to show that if data are replaced, the test error increases with the number of model-fitting iterations; we extend this argument to prove that if data instead accumulate, the test error has a finite upper bound independent of the number of iterations, meaning model collapse no longer occurs.},

This can enable organizations to build models on data they otherwise would not be able to access. Evaluation with real-world data collected from 16 taxi service providers in Japan over a period of six months showed that the proposed system can predict the demand level accurately within 1\% error compared to a single model trained with integrated data.},

This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.},

However, it remains challenging to ensure that the generated geospatial mobility data is semantically realistic, including consistent location sequences, and reflects real-world characteristics, such as constraining on geospatial limits. We reformat human mobility modeling as an autoregressive generation task to address these issues, leveraging the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture. To ensure its controllable generation to alleviate the above challenges, we propose a geospatially-aware generative model, MobilityGPT. We propose a gravity-based sampling method to train a transformer for semantic sequence similarity. Then, we constrained the training process via a road connectivity matrix that provides the connectivity of sequences in trajectory generation, thereby keeping generated trajectories in geospatial limits. Lastly, we proposed to construct a preference dataset for fine-tuning MobilityGPT via Reinforcement Learning from Trajectory Feedback (RLTF) mechanism, which minimizes the travel distance between training and the synthetically generated trajectories. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate MobilityGPT's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality mobility trajectories that are closest to real data in terms of origin-destination similarity, trip length, travel radius, link, and gravity distributions.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of GPS positioning and wireless communication, more and more trajectories are collected. How to accurately and efficiently detect abnormal trajectories from a large number of trajectories has become a focused issue. The similarity measurement method adopted by the existing abnormal trajectory detection technology often ignores the situation that the abnormal sub-trajectory has enough neighbors. If a trajectory is composed of multiple such subtrajectories, this anomaly will not be detected. At present, the trajectory outlier detection algorithm based on common slices sub-sequence(T ODCSS) has improved the above problems. However, it is not accurate enough in feature extraction. Its detection scope is limited to 2D-plane and the time dimension is ignored, so it can't detect abnormal vehicle behaviors such as multiple stops, detention, too slow speed and so on. Based on the above problems, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal trajectory anomaly detection based on common sub-sequence (ST ADCS). Firstly, in order to obtain accurate and reasonable similar trajectories, the length of sub-trajectory is added to the common sequence of trajectories, and non-common parts between two trajectories are added to the similarity measurement. Then the time is added to detect trajectories of time anomalies. It improves the accuracy and rationality of detection. Finally, we conducted experiments on real datasets and used F 1 - measure to evaluate the accuracy of this algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, the accuracy of ST ADCS is improved by about 15.15\%.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

  abstract = {Region profiles are summaries of characteristics of urban regions. Region profiling is a process to discover the correlations between urban regions. The learned urban profiles can be used to represent and identify regions in supporting downstream tasks, e.g., region traffic status estimation. While some efforts have been made to model urban regions, representation learning with awareness of graph-structured data can improve the existing methods. To do this, we first construct an attribute spatio-temporal graph, in which a node represents a region, an edge represents mobility across regions, and a node attribute represents a region's point of interest (PoI) distribution. The problem of region profiling is reformulated as a representation learning problem based on attribute spatio-temporal graphs. To solve this problem, we developed URGENT, a spatio-temporal graph learning framework. URGENT is made up of two modules. The graph convolutional neural network is used in the first module to learn spatial dependencies. The second module is an encoding--decoding temporal learning structure with self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the learned representations of regions to estimate region traffic status. Experimental results demonstrate that URGENT outperforms major baselines in estimation accuracy under various settings and produces more meaningful results.},

  abstract = {Human mobility modeling from GPS-trajectories and synthetic trajectory generation are crucial for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster management and epidemiology. Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98\% of spatial accuracy on average.},

  abstract = {Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single, unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.},

Therefore, it is important to monitor taxis' operation to enhance the quality of taxi services. In this paper, we mainly study the anomaly detection of taxi trajectories in the spatial dimension with a novel taxi anomaly detection framework based on real-time vehicle trajectory prediction. The framework is termed as TAPS and consists of two stages: the offline training stage and the online anomaly detection stage. In the first stage, a vehicle prediction model is established by training recommended routes provided by a navigation platform to predict a taxi's next locations. The second step is to detect the taxi's anomalous trajectories by measuring the consistency between its current and predicted positions as well as the relationship between these two positions and the origin. The effectiveness and timeliness of TAPS are evaluated in a real-world case study. The experiment results show that compared with two baselines, TAPS achieves greater Accuracy, Precision and F1 score to detect anomalous trajectories. This proposed framework can serve as a fundamental tool to detect anomalous trajectories for taxi passengers and companies.},

  abstract = {Mechanical defects in real situations affect observation values and cause abnormalities in multivariate time series, such as sensor values or network data. To perceive abnormalities in such data, it is crucial to understand the temporal context and interrelation between variables simultaneously. The anomaly detection task for time series, especially for unlabeled data, has been a challenging problem, and we address it by applying a suitable data degradation scheme to selfsupervised model training. We define four types of synthetic outliers and propose the degradation scheme in which a portion of input data is replaced with one of the synthetic outliers. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism, we design a Transformer-based architecture to recognize the temporal context and detect unnatural sequences with high efficiency. Our model converts multivariate data points into temporal representations with relative position bias and yields anomaly scores from these representations. Our method, AnomalyBERT, shows a great capability of detecting anomalies contained in complex time series and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on five real-world benchmarks.

To address these issues, we propose LibCity, an open-source library that offers researchers a credible experimental tool and a convenient development framework. In this library, we have reproduced 65 spatial-temporal prediction models and collected 55 spatial-temporal datasets, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive experiments conveniently.

  abstract = {Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) is a powerful tool for spatial-temporal data analysis and management. TRL aims to convert complicated raw trajectories into low-dimensional representation vectors, which can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as trajectory classification, clustering, and similarity computation. Existing TRL works usually treat trajectories as ordinary sequence data, while some important spatial-temporal characteristics, such as temporal regularities and travel semantics, are not fully exploited. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Self-supervised trajectory representation learning framework with TemporAl Regularities and Travel semantics, namely START. The proposed method consists of two stages. The first stage is a Trajectory Pattern-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (TPE-GAT), which converts the road network features and travel semantics into representation vectors of road segments. The second stage is a Time-Aware Trajectory Encoder (TAT-Enc), which encodes representation vectors of road segments in the same trajectory as a trajectory representation vector, meanwhile incorporating temporal regularities with the trajectory representation. Moreover, we also design two self-supervised tasks, i.e., span-masked trajectory recovery and trajectory contrastive learning, to introduce spatial-temporal characteristics of trajectories into the training process of our START framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets for three downstream tasks. The experiments also demonstrate that our method can be transferred across different cities to adapt heterogeneous trajectory datasets.},

  abstract = {The growing number of cars on city roads has led to an increase in traffic accidents, highlighting the need for traffic safety measures. Mobile trajectory anomaly detection is an important area of research that can identify unusual patterns or trajectories in urban environments and provide timely warnings to drivers to avoid accidents. However, there is a significant lack of research on the analysis of vehicle trajectory anomalies. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive review of currently published papers on anomalous trajectories, highlighting important research trends and future directions. Besides, we innovatively classify trajectory anomalies into vehicle-based anomalies and driver-based anomalies according to whether they are caused by the driver's behavior or not. The study further examines the existing challenges associated with analyzing anomalous trajectories and assesses the currently available solutions.},

  abstract = {Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are currently becoming the leading paradigm of generative modeling for many important data modalities. Being the most prevalent in the computer vision community, diffusion models have also recently gained some attention in other domains, including speech, NLP, and graph-like data. In this work, we investigate if the framework of diffusion models can be advantageous for general tabular problems, where datapoints are typically represented by vectors of heterogeneous features. The inherent heterogeneity of tabular data makes it quite challenging for accurate modeling, since the individual features can be of completely different nature, i.e., some of them can be continuous and some of them can be discrete. To address such data types, we introduce TabDDPM -- a diffusion model that can be universally applied to any tabular dataset and handles any type of feature. We extensively evaluate TabDDPM on a wide set of benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over existing GAN/VAE alternatives, which is consistent with the advantage of diffusion models in other fields. Additionally, we show that TabDDPM is eligible for privacy-oriented setups, where the original datapoints cannot be publicly shared.},

However, few studies have studied the impact of electricity price on electric vehicle charging behavior, especially the demand spillover effect caused by price fluctuations. To fill the gaps, on a citywide dataset of public charging piles in Shenzhen, China, first, correlation coefficients and hypothesis tests are used to determine the relationship between charging demand and price. A learning model incorporating two-layer graph attention, temporal pattern attention, and knowledge-embedded meta-learning is developed for accurate spatio-temporal regression. Impulse response analysis is conducted to unravel several noteworthy phenomena: (1) public charging demand is inelastic to electricity price, with an average elasticity of -0.76, and distinction between different functional areas and times is revealed; (2) negative price impulses marginally change the elasticity, while positive ones make electric vehicle charging users more price sensitive, and (3) the spillover effects caused by price increases and decreases bring 89.48\% and 53.88\% of its local demand changes to neighbors, respectively, with a scope of 3.45 kilometer. These findings provide policy implications for promoting electric vehicle charging to facilitate renewable energy transition.},

  abstract = {Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial to autonomous driving and understanding the surrounding environment. Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9\%/11.8\% on the NBA dataset.

  abstract = {Logs are essential for software systems to perform anomaly detection, but the scarcity of high-quality public log datasets has significantly hindered the development of log-based anomaly detection techniques. Existing public log datasets suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage, (2) lack of authenticity in static analysis-based automated generation frameworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework for anomaly detection. The framework features a novel four-phase architecture that synergistically combines enhanced program analysis with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable iterative log generation and anomaly annotation without requiring actual system execution. Experimental evaluations on Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves significantly higher log event coverage (38{\texttimes}--95{\texttimes} improvement over existing datasets) and generates more realistic log sequences compared to static analysis-based tools. When augmenting benchmark datasets with AnomalyGen-generated data, we observe up to 3.7\% improvement in F1-score (1.8\% average improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This work establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated log analysis and pioneers a new paradigm for LLM applications in software engineering.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of sensor technology has resulted in a vast volume of traffic trajectory data, and trajectory anomaly detection has a wide range of applications in sectors including smart transportation, autonomous driving, and video surveillance. Trajectory anomaly detection, unlike other trajectory mining tasks like classification, clustering, and prediction, tries to find low-probability, uncertain, and unusual trajectory behavior. The types of anomalies, trajectory data labels, detection accuracy, and computational complexity are all frequent issues in trajectory anomaly detection. In view of the above problems, the research status and latest progress of trajectory anomaly detection technology in the past two decades are comprehensively reviewed. First, the characteristics of trajectory anomaly detection and the current research challenges are analyzed. Then, the existing trajectory anomaly detection algorithms are compared and analyzed based on the classification criteria such as the availability of trajectory labels, the principle of anomaly detection algorithms, and the working mode of offline or online algorithms. For each type of anomaly detection technology, the algorithm principle, representative method, complexity analysis and algorithm advantages and disadvantages are summarized and analyzed in detail. Then, the open source trajectory datasets, commonly used anomaly detection evaluation methods and anomaly detection tools are discussed. On this basis, the architecture of the trajectory anomaly detection system is presented, and a series of relatively complete trajectory mining processes from trajectory data collection to anomaly detection application are formed. Finally, the significant open issues in the domain of trajectory anomaly detection are discussed, as well as potential research trends and solutions.},

  abstract = {Vehicle trajectory anomaly detection plays an essential role in the fields of traffic video surveillance, autonomous driving navigation, and taxi fraud detection. Deep generative models have been shown to be promising solutions for anomaly detection, avoiding the costs involved in manual labeling. However, existing popular generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) are often plagued by training instability, mode collapse, and poor sample quality. To resolve the dilemma, we present DiffTAD, a novel vehicle trajectory anomaly detection framework based on the emerging diffusion models. DiffTAD formalizes anomaly detection as a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the vehicle trajectory until the path is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The core idea of our framework is to devise deep neural networks to learn the reverse of the diffusion process and to detect anomalies by comparing the difference between a query trajectory and its reconstruction. DiffTAD is a parameterized Markov chain trained with variational inference and allows the mean square error to optimize the reweighted variational lower bound. In addition, DiffTAD integrates decoupled Transformer-based temporal and spatial encoders to model the temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among vehicles in the diffusion models. Experiments on the real-world trajectory dataset TRAFFIC demonstrate that our DiffTAD achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with the maximum enhancements reaching 25.87\% and 35.59\% in terms of AUC and F1. While on the synthetic datasets CROSS, SynTra, and MAAD, the maximum improvements in AUC/F1 are 27.47\%/38.56\%, 25.38\%/31.42\%, and 58.22\%/50.04\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey ({\S}ADGDM) aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.},

This model employs the R3D network as its core architecture, incorporating a dense block to facilitate feature reuse. This approach not only enhances performance with fewer parameters and reduced computational demands but also allows for the acquisition of new features while simplifying the overall network structure. Additionally, this research integrates a self-attentive method that dynamically adjusts to the prevailing traffic conditions, optimizing the relevance of features for the task at hand. For temporal analysis, a Bi-LSTM layer is utilized to extract and learn from time-based data nuances. This research conducted a series of comparative experiments using the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving a notable accuracy of 89.30\% on our test set. Our results demonstrate that our model not only operates with fewer parameters but also achieves superior recognition accuracy compared to previous models.},

  abstract = {Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85\% for traffic volume and 4.36\% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.},

  abstract = {Trajectory representation learning plays a pivotal role in supporting various downstream tasks, such as travel time estimation, trajectory classification and Top-k similar trajectory search. Traditional methods in order to filter the noise in GPS trajectories tend to focus on routing-based methods to simplify the trajectories. However, these approaches ignore the motion details contained in the GPS data, limiting the representation capability of trajectory representation learning. To fill this gap, we propose a novel representation learning framework that is Jointly G PS and Route Modeling based on self-supervised technology, namely JGRM. We consider GPS trajectory and route trajectory as the two modals of a single movement observation and fuse information through inter-modal information interaction. Specifically, we develop two encoders, each tailored to capture representations of GPS trajectories and route trajectories respectively. The representations from these two modalities are fed into a shared transformer for inter-modal information interaction. Eventually, we design three self-supervised tasks to train the model. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two real-world datasets through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that JGRM significantly outperforms existing methods in both road segment representation and trajectory representation tasks.

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) and the semantic enrichment of mobility data in several contexts in the last few years has led to the generation of large volumes of trajectory data. In contrast to GPS-based trajectories, LBSN and context-aware trajectories are more complex data, having several semantic textual dimensions besides space and time, which may reveal interesting mobility patterns. For instance, people may visit different places or perform different activities depending on the weather conditions and their geographical location. Animals may choose their habitat based on climate and vegetation characteristics. These new semantically rich data, known as multiple-aspect trajectories, pose new challenges in trajectory classification, which is the problem that we address in this paper. Existing methods for trajectory classification cannot deal with the complexity of heterogeneous data dimensions or the sequential aspect that characterizes movement. In this paper we propose MARC, an approach based on attribute embedding and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for classifying multiple-aspect trajectories, that tackles all trajectory properties: space, time, semantics, and sequence. We highlight that MARC exhibits good performance especially when trajectories are described by several textual/categorical attributes. Experiments performed over four publicly available datasets considering the Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) problem show that MARC outperformed all competitors in all datasets, with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.

  abstract = {In modern air traffic management, generating synthetic flight trajectories has emerged as a promising solution for addressing data scarcity, protecting sensitive information, and supporting large-scale analyses. In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.},

  abstract = {Accurate taxi-demand prediction is essential for optimizing taxi operations and enhancing urban transportation services. However, using customers' data in these systems raises significant privacy and security concerns. Traditional federated learning addresses some privacy issues by enabling model training without direct data exchange but often struggles with accuracy due to varying data distributions across different regions or service providers. In this paper, we propose CC-Net: a novel approach using collaborative learning enhanced with contrastive learning for taxi-demand prediction. Our method ensures high performance by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train a demand-prediction model through hierarchical federated learning. In this approach, similar parties are clustered together, and federated learning is applied within each cluster. The similarity is defined without data exchange, ensuring privacy and security. We evaluated our approach using real-world data from five taxi service providers in Japan over fourteen months. The results demonstrate that CC-Net maintains the privacy of customers' data while improving prediction accuracy by at least 2.2\% compared to existing techniques.},

  abstract = {Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in location-based services that aim to provide personalized suggestions for the user's next destination. Previous works on POI recommendation have laid focus on modeling the user's spatial preference. However, existing works that leverage spatial information are only based on the aggregation of users' previous visited positions, which discourages the model from recommending POIs in novel areas. This trait of position-based methods will harm the model's performance in many situations. Additionally, incorporating sequential information into the user's spatial preference remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Diff-POI: a Diffusion-based model that samples the user's spatial preference for the next POI recommendation. Inspired by the wide application of diffusion algorithm in sampling from distributions, Diff-POI encodes the user's visiting sequence and spatial character with two tailor-designed graph encoding modules, followed by a diffusion-based sampling strategy to explore the user's spatial visiting trends. We leverage the diffusion process and its reversed form to sample from the posterior distribution and optimized the corresponding score function. We design a joint training and inference framework to optimize and evaluate the proposed Diff-POI. Extensive experiments on four real-world POI recommendation datasets demonstrate the superiority of our Diff-POI over state-of-the-art baseline methods. Further ablation and parameter studies on Diff-POI reveal the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed diffusion-based sampling strategy for addressing the limitations of existing methods.

  abstract = {Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation plays a vital role in various location-aware services. It has been observed that POI recommendation is driven by both sequential and geographical influences. However, since there is no annotated label of the dominant influence during recommendation, existing methods tend to entangle these two influences, which may lead to sub-optimal recommendation performance and poor interpretability. In this paper, we address the above challenge by proposing DisenPOI, a novel Disentangled dual-graph framework for POI recommendation, which jointly utilizes sequential and geographical relationships on two separate graphs and disentangles the two influences with self-supervision. The key novelty of our model compared with existing approaches is to extract disentangled representations of both sequential and geographical influences with contrastive learning. To be specific, we construct a geographical graph and a sequential graph based on the check-in sequence of a user. We tailor their propagation schemes to become sequence-/geo-aware to better capture the corresponding influences. Preference proxies are extracted from check-in sequence as pseudo labels for the two influences, which supervise the disentanglement via a contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {With the advent of GPS tracking technology, how to make use of taxi trajectories to efficiently and effectively reduce taxis cruising distance is an active and challenging research topic. In this paper, we propose a profitable taxi route recommendation method called adaptive shortest expected cruising route (ASER). In ASER, a probabilistic network model is developed to predict pick-up probability and capacity of each location by using Kalman filtering method. To recommend profitable driving routes to taxi drivers, ASER takes the load balance between passengers and taxis into consideration and the shortest expected cruising distance is introduced to formulate potential cruising distance of taxis. Moreover, MapReduce and a novel data structure kdS-tree are applied to improve recommendation efficiency. ASER is evaluated on two real trajectory datasets from San Francisco, CA, USA, and Wuhan, China. The experimental results validate that ASER significantly outperforms the existing methods by reducing the taxi cruising distance 11\% and 39\%.},

  abstract = {Massive data broadcast by GPS-equipped vehicles provide unprecedented opportunities. One of the main tasks in order to optimize our transportation networks is to build data-driven real-time decision support systems. However, the dynamic environments where the networks operate disallow the traditional assumptions required to put in practice many off-the-shelf supervised learning algorithms, such as finite training sets or stationary distributions. In this paper, we propose BRIGHT: a drift-aware supervised learning framework to predict demand quantities. BRIGHT aims to provide accurate predictions for short-term horizons through a creative ensemble of time series analysis methods that handles distinct types of concept drift. By selecting neighborhoods dynamically, BRIGHT reduces the likelihood of overfitting. By ensuring diversity among the base learners, BRIGHT ensures a high reduction of variance while keeping bias stable. Experiments were conducted using three large-scale heterogeneous real-world transportation networks in Porto (Portugal), Shanghai (China), and Stockholm (Sweden), as well as with controlled experiments using synthetic data where multiple distinct drifts were artificially induced. The obtained results illustrate the advantages of BRIGHT in relation to state-of-the-art methods for this task.},

With the aim of rigorously understanding model collapse in language models, we consider in this paper a statistical model that allows us to characterize the impact of various recursive training scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that model collapse cannot be avoided when training solely on synthetic data. However, when mixing both real and synthetic data, we provide an estimate of a maximal amount of synthetic data below which model collapse can eventually be avoided. Our theoretical conclusions are further supported by empirical validations.},

  abstract = {Travel time prediction of a given trajectory plays an indispensable role in intelligent transportation systems. Although many prior researches have struggled for accurate prediction results, most of them achieve inferior performance due to insufficient feature extraction of travel speed and road network structure from the trajectory data, which confirms the challenges involved in this topic. To overcome those issues, we propose a novel neural Network for Travel Time Prediction based on tensor decomposition and graph embedding, named TTPNet, which can extract travel speed and representation of road network structure effectively from historical trajectories, as well as predict the travel time with better accuracy. Specifically, TTPNet consists of three components: the first module (Travel Speed Features Layer) leverages non-negative tensor decomposition to restore travel speed distributions on different roads in the previous hour, and integrates a CNN-RNN model to extract both long-term and short-term travel speed features of the query trajectory; the second module (Road Network Structure Features Layer) utilizes graph embedding to generate the representation of local and global road network structure; the last module (Deep LSTM Prediction Layer) completes the final predicting task. Empirical results over two real-world large-scale datasets show that our proposed TTPNet model can achieve significantly better performance and remarkable robustness.},

Generating synthetic data by applying pre-determined transformations that conform to a set of known invariances has shown to improve performance of such deep models. In this work we present C-GATS to show that one can learn a much larger invariance space using the available sparse data by training a conditional generative model to do Data Augmentation (DA) for anomalous Time Series (TS) in a model-agnostic way. Particularly, we factorize an anomalous TS sequence into 3 attributes--- normal sub-sequence, anomalous sub-sequence, and position of the anomaly and model each of them separately. This factorization helps exploit samples from the dominant class i.e normal TS to train a generative model for the sparse class i.e anomalous TS. We provide an exhaustive study to showcase that C-GATS not only learns to generate different types of anomalies (eg: point anomalies and level-shift) but those generated anomalies improve performance of multiple SOTA TS AD models on a set of popular public TS AD benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {In the realm of human mobility data analysis, a multitude of constraints result in the publication of sparse, non-uniform implicit trajectories without explicit location information, such as coordinates. Researchers have dedicated substantial efforts towards trajectory recovery, aiming to densify trajectories and gain a more comprehensive understanding of human mobility. However, existing trajectory recovery methods focus on explicit trajectories, and require extensive historical data to capture users' mobility patterns. Nevertheless, implicit trajectories are usually more sparse than explicit trajectories. Addressing these challenges, we propose TrajBERT, an innovative BERT-based trajectory recovery method with spatial-temporal refinement. TrajBERT employs the Transformer encoder to learn mobility patterns bi-directionally and enhances the predictions by cross-stage temporal refinement. Subsequently, we design an output layer with global spatial refinement with a novel spatial-temporal aware loss function. To evaluate the performance of TrajBERT, we conduct a series of experiments on real-world datasets. Remarkably, TrajBERT yields at least 8.2\% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art trajectory recovery approachs. Furthermore, TrajBERT successfully mitigates the cold start problem commonly experienced with new users lacking historical trajectories. It also shows superior robustness when faced with extremely sparse trajectories, thus demonstrating its potential as a practical tool in the field of human mobility analysis.},

To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on multimodal deep fusion and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs), incorporating an Ensemble Contrastive Pessimistic Likelihood Estimation (CPLE) algorithm to optimize performance. The framework integrates static and dynamic traffic data, such as video images, traffic flow, vehicle speed, and tunnel weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the model performs well in various scenarios, showing significant improvement in accuracy and stability over existing models like AGC-LSTM and AttentionDeepST. For instance, the proposed MHGNN-CPLE model achieves superior accuracy and F1 score in static detection tasks while maintaining high accuracy under different noise levels in dynamic detection scenarios. This study provides a significant advancement in traffic event analysis by effectively combining multimodal data and leveraging HGNNs to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies.},

  abstract = {In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec.

It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results.

Ride-hailing platforms have conducted meticulous background checks for drivers to minimize the risk of abnormal trips, e.g. violence and sexual assault. However, current methods are labor-consuming and highly rely on the personal information of drivers, which may harm the fairness of the order dispatching system. In this paper, we utilize the trip trajectories as inputs and propose a dual variational auto-encoder(VAE) framework, namely TripSafe, to estimate the probability of abnormal safety incidents. Specifically, TripSafe models the moving behavior and route information, as two independent components and employs VAEs to pre-train generative models for normal trips. Then, a fusion network is adopted to fine-tune the whole model with a few labeled samples. In practice, TripSafe monitors the data update and calculate the anomaly score of partial-observed trips in real-time. Experiments on real ridehailing data show that TripSafe is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines with about 14.2\%{$\sim$}28.9\% improvements on F1 score.},

  abstract = {Trajectory anomalies serve as early indicators of potential issues and frequently provide valuable insights into event occurrence. Existing methods for detecting abnormal trajectories primarily focus on comparing the spatial characteristics of the trajectories. However, they fail to capture the temporal dimension's pattern and evolution within the trajectory data, thereby inadequately identifying the behavioral inertia of the target group. A few detection methods that incorporate spatiotemporal features have also failed to adequately analyze the spatiotemporal sequence evolution information; consequently, detection methods that ignore temporal and spatial correlations are too one-sided. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially gate recurrent unit (GRU) that design reset and update gate control units, process nonlinear sequence processing capabilities, enabling effective extraction and analysis of both temporal and spatial characteristics. However, the basic GRU network model has limited expressive power and may not be able to adequately capture complex sequence patterns and semantic information. To address the above issues, an abnormal trajectory detection method based on the improved GRU model is proposed in cloud computing in this paper. To enhance the anomaly detection ability and training efficiency of relevant models, strictly control the input of irrelevant features and improve the model fitting effect, an improved model combining the random forest algorithm and fully connected layer network is designed. The method deconstructs spatiotemporal semantics through reset and update gated units, while effectively capturing feature evolution information and target behavioral inertia by leveraging the integration of features and nonlinear mapping capabilities of the fully connected layer network. The experimental results based on the GeoLife GPS trajectory dataset indicate that the proposed approach improves both generalization ability by 1\% and reduces training cost by 31.68\%. This success do provides a practical solution for the task of anomaly trajectory detection.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of continuously connected smartphones and tablets developed the usage of mobile applications, among which many use location to provide geolocated services. These services provide new prospects for users: getting directions to work in the morning, leaving a check-in at a restaurant at noon and checking next day's weather in the evening are possible right from any mobile device embedding a GPS chip. In these location-based applications, the user's location is sent to a server, which uses them to provide contextual and personalised answers. However, nothing prevents the latter from gathering, analysing and possibly sharing the collected information, which opens the door to many privacy threats. Indeed, mobility data can reveal sensitive information about users, among which one's home, work place or even religious and political preferences. For this reason, many privacy-preserving mechanisms have been proposed these last years to enhance location privacy while using geolocated services. This article surveys and organises contributions in this area from classical building blocks to the most recent developments of privacy threats and location privacy-preserving mechanisms. We divide the protection mechanisms between online and offline use cases, and organise them into six categories depending on the nature of their algorithm. Moreover, this article surveys the evaluation metrics used to assess protection mechanisms in terms of privacy, utility and performance. Finally, open challenges and new directions to address the problem of computational location privacy are pointed out and discussed.},

These anomalous driving trajectories provide us an opportunity to extract driver or passenger behaviors and monitor adverse urban traffic events. Because various trajectory clustering methods have previously proven to be an effective means to analyze similarities and anomalies within taxi GPS trajectory data, we focus on the problem of detecting anomalous taxi trajectories, and we develop our trajectory clustering method based on the edit distance and hierarchical clustering. To achieve this objective, first, we obtain all the taxi trajectories crossing the same source--destination pairs from taxi trajectories and take these trajectories as clustering objects. Second, an edit distance algorithm is modified to measure the similarity of the trajectories. Then, we distinguish regular trajectories and anomalous trajectories by applying adaptive hierarchical clustering based on an optimal number of clusters. Moreover, we further analyze these anomalous trajectories and discover four anomalous behavior patterns to speculate on the cause of an anomaly based on statistical indicators of time and length. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect anomalous trajectories and can be used to infer clearly fraudulent driving routes and the occurrence of adverse traffic events.},

  abstract = {Trajectory representation learning aims to transform raw trajectory data into compact and lowdimensional vectors that are suitable for downstream analysis. However, most existing methods adopt either a free-space view or a roadnetwork view during the learning process, which limits their ability to capture the complex, multiview spatiotemporal features inherent in trajectory data. Moreover, these approaches rely on task-specific model training, restricting their generalizability and effectiveness for diverse analysis tasks. To this end, we propose GTR, a general, multi-view, and dynamic Trajectory Representation framework built on a pre-train and fine-tune architecture. Specifically, GTR introduces a multi-view encoder that captures the intrinsic multi-view spatiotemporal features. Based on the pre-train and fine-tune architecture, we provide the spatio-temporal fusion pre-training with a spatio-temporal mixture of experts to dynamically combine spatial and temporal features, enabling seamless adaptation to diverse trajectory analysis tasks. Furthermore, we propose an online frozen-hot updating strategy to efficiently update the representation model, accommodating the dynamic nature of trajectory data. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods across 6 mainstream trajectory analysis tasks.

In the encoder-decoder model, we propose an hard attention mechanism based on learning similar patterns to enhance neuronal memory and reduce the accumulation of error propagation.

The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. It is verified that our model can accurately learn local feature and long-term dependence, and has better accuracy and stability in long-term sequence prediction.},

  abstract = {A trajectory is a sequence of timestamped point locations that captures the movement of an object such as a vehicle. Such trajectories encode complex spatial and temporal patterns and provide rich information about object mobility and the underlying infrastructures, typically road networks, within which the movements occur. A trajectory dataset is evolving when new trajectories are included continuously. The ability to detect anomalous trajectories in online fashion in this setting is fundamental and challenging functionality that has many applications, e.g., location-based services. State-of-the-art solutions determine anomalies based on the shapes or routes of trajectories, ignoring potential anomalies caused by different sampling rates or time offsets. We propose a multi-scale model, termed MST-OATD, for anomalous streaming trajectory detection that considers both the spatial and temporal aspects of trajectories. The model's multi-scale capabilities aim to enable extraction of trajectory features at multiple scales. In addition, to improve model evolvability and to contend with changes in trajectory patterns, the model is equipped with a learned ranking model that updates the training set as new trajectories are included. Experiments on real datasets offer evidence that the model can outperform state-of-the-art solutions and is capable of real-time anomaly detection. Further, the learned ranking model achieves promising results when updating the training set with newly arrived trajectories.},

Moreover, in most current methods, trajectories are represented by geometric features or their low-dimensional linear combination, and some hidden features and high-dimensional combined features cannot be found efficiently. Meanwhile, traditional methods still cannot get rid of the limitation of space attributes. Therefore, a novel trajectory anomaly detection algorithm is present in this article. Unsupervised learning mechanism is used to overcome nonground-truth problem and deep representation method is used to represent trajectories in a comprehensive way. First, each trajectory is partitioned into segments according to its open angles, then the shallow features at each point of a segment are extracted and. In this way, each segment is represented as a feature sequence. Second, shallow features are integrated into auto-encoder-based deep feature fusion model, and the fusion feature sequences can be extracted. Third, these fused feature sequences are grouped into different clusters using a unsupervised clustering algorithm, and then segments which quite differ from others are detected as anomalies. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency of our work.},

  abstract = {Estimating the travel time of any path (denoted by a sequence of connected road segments) in a city is of great importance to traffic monitoring, route planning, ridesharing, taxi/Uber dispatching, etc. However, it is a very challenging problem, affected by diverse complex factors, including spatial correlations, temporal dependencies, external conditions (e.g. weather, traffic lights). Prior work usually focuses on estimating the travel times of individual road segments or sub-paths and then summing up these times, which leads to an inaccurate estimation because such approaches do not consider road intersections/traffic lights, and local errors may accumulate. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Deep learning framework for Travel Time Estimation (called DeepTTE) that estimates the travel time of the whole path directly. More specifically, we present a geo-convolution operation by integrating the geographic information into the classical convolution, capable of capturing spatial correlations. By stacking recurrent unit on the geo-convoluton layer, our DeepTTE can capture the temporal dependencies as well. A multi-task learning component is given on the top of DeepTTE, that learns to estimate the travel time of both the entire path and each local path simultaneously during the training phase. Extensive experiments on two trajectory datasets show our DeepTTE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Trajectory data is essential for various applications as it records the movement of vehicles. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, {\textbackslash}emph\{i.e.\}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a short-term traffic flow prediction model that combines community detection-based federated learning with a graph convolutional network (GCN) to alleviate the time-consuming training, higher communication costs, and data privacy risks of global GCNs as the amount of data increases. The federated community GCN (FCGCN) can achieve timely, accurate, and safe traffic state predictions in the era of big traffic data, which is critical for the efficient operation of intelligent transportation systems. The FCGCN prediction process has four steps: dividing the local subnetwork with community detection, local training based on the global parameters, uploading the local model parameters, and constructing a global model prediction based on the aggregated parameters. Numerical results on the PeMS04 and PeMS08 datasets show that the FCGCN outperforms four benchmark models, namely, the long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), ChebNet, and graph attention network (GAT) models. The FCGCN prediction is closer to the real value, with nearly the same performance as the global model at a lower time cost, thus achieving accurate and secure short-term traffic flow predictions with three parameters: flow, speed, and occupancy.},

  abstract = {Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful generative framework that have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, the high computational cost of training DMs limits their practical applications. In this paper, we start with a consistency phenomenon of DMs: we observe that DMs with different initializations or even different architectures can produce very similar outputs given the same noise inputs, which is rare in other generative models. We attribute this phenomenon to two factors: (1) the learning difficulty of DMs is lower when the noise-prediction diffusion model approaches the upper bound of the timestep (the input becomes pure noise), where the structural information of the output is usually generated; and (2) the loss landscape of DMs is highly smooth, which implies that the model tends to converge to similar local minima and exhibit similar behavior patterns. This finding not only reveals the stability of DMs, but also inspires us to devise two strategies to accelerate the training of DMs. First, we propose a curriculum learning based timestep schedule, which leverages the noise rate as an explicit indicator of the learning difficulty and gradually reduces the training frequency of easier timesteps, thus improving the training efficiency. Second, we propose a momentum decay strategy, which reduces the momentum coefficient during the optimization process, as the large momentum may hinder the convergence speed and cause oscillations due to the smoothness of the loss landscape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies on various models and show that they can significantly reduce the training time and improve the quality of the generated images.},

Existing models, derived from fundamental laws of human mobility, often capture only partial facets of this complexity. This article introduces DeepMobility, a powerful deep generative collaboration network designed to encapsulate the multifaceted nature of complex urban mobility within one unified model, bridging the gap between the heterogeneous behaviors of individuals and the collective behaviors emerging from the entire population. As the first generative deep learning model to integrate micro- and macrolevel dynamics through bidirectional collaboration, DeepMobility generates high-fidelity synthetic mobility data, overcoming key limitations of prior approaches. Our experiments, conducted on mobility trajectories and flows in cities of China and Senegal, reveal that unlike state-of-the-art deep learning models that tend to ``memorize'' observed data, DeepMobility excels in learning the intricate data distribution and successfully reproduces the existing universal scaling laws that characterize human mobility behaviors at both individual and population levels. DeepMobility also exhibits robust generalization capabilities, enabling it to generate realistic trajectories and flows for cities lacking corresponding training data. Our approach underscores the feasibility of employing generative deep learning to model the underlying mechanism of human mobility and establishes a versatile framework for mobility data generation that supports sustainable and livable cities.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal point process (STPP) is a stochastic collection of events accompanied with time and space. Due to computational complexities, existing solutions for STPPs compromise with conditional independence between time and space, which consider the temporal and spatial distributions separately. The failure to model the joint distribution leads to limited capacities in characterizing the spatio-temporal entangled interactions given past events. In this work, we propose a novel parameterization framework for STPPs, which leverages diffusion models to learn complex spatio-temporal joint distributions. We decompose the learning of the target joint distribution into multiple steps, where each step can be faithfully described by a Gaussian distribution. To enhance the learning of each step, an elaborated spatio-temporal co-attention module is proposed to capture the interdependence between the event time and space adaptively. For the first time, we break the restrictions on spatio-temporal dependencies in existing solutions, and enable a flexible and accurate modeling paradigm for STPPs. Extensive experiments from a wide range of fields, such as epidemiology, seismology, crime, and urban mobility, demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines remarkably, with an average improvement of over 50\%. Further in-depth analyses validate its ability to capture spatio-temporal interactions, which can learn adaptively for different scenarios.

However, this task faces significant challenges, including coarse-grained user interest representation, insufficient social modeling, sparse check-in data, and the insufficient learning of contextual patterns. To address this, we propose a model that combines check-in trajectory information with user friendship relationships and uses a Transformer architecture for prediction (TraFriendFormer). Our approach begins with the construction of trajectory flow graphs using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to globally capture POI correlations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. In parallel, we design an integrated social graph that combines explicit friendships with implicit interaction patterns, in which GraphSAGE aggregates neighborhood information to generate enriched user embeddings. Finally, we fuse the POI embeddings, user embeddings, timestamp embeddings, and category embeddings and input them into the Transformer architecture. Through the self-attention mechanism, the model captures the complex temporal relationships in the check-in sequence. We validate the effectiveness of TraFriendFormer on two real-world datasets (FourSquare and Gowalla). The experimental results show that TraFriendFormer achieves an average improvement of 10.3\% to 37.2\% in metrics such as Acc@k and MRR compared to the selected state-of-the-art baselines.},

To mitigate these issues, we propose three strategies: (1) a prompt construction and filtering pipeline designed to facilitate the generation of perceptual aligned data, (2) a preference sampling method to identify human-preferred samples and filter out generative hallucinations, and (3) a distribution-based weighting scheme to penalize selected samples with hallucinatory errors.

  abstract = {With the advancement of mobile technology, Point of Interest (POI) recommendation systems in Location-based Social Networks (LBSN) have brought numerous benefits to both users and companies. Many existing works employ Knowledge Graph (KG) to alleviate the data sparsity issue in LBSN. These approaches primarily focus on modeling the pair-wise relations in LBSN to enrich the semantics and thereby relieve the data sparsity issue. However, existing approaches seldom consider the hyper-relations in LBSN, such as the mobility relation (a 3-ary relation: user-POI-time). This makes the model hard to exploit the semantics accurately. In addition, prior works overlook the rich structural information inherent in KG, which consists of higher-order relations and can further alleviate the impact of data sparsity.To this end, we propose a Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Neural Network (HKGNN) model. In HKGNN, a Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph (HKG) that models the LBSN data is constructed to maintain and exploit the rich semantics of hyperrelations. Then we proposed a Hypergraph Neural Network to utilize the structural information of HKG in a cohesive way. In addition, a self-attention network is used to leverage sequential information and make personalized recommendations. Furthermore, side information, essential in reducing data sparsity by providing background knowledge of POIs, is not fully utilized in current methods. In light of this, we extended the current dataset with available side information to further lessen the impact of data sparsity. Results of experiments on four real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing state-ofthe-art methods.},

To address this limitation, we propose MaskPOI, a novel self-supervised learning framework that combines the strengths of graph neural networks and masked modeling. MaskPOI incorporates two complementary modules: an edge mask-based graph autoencoder that models the spatial topology by predicting edge existence and uncovering hidden spatial relationships and a feature mask-based graph autoencoder that reconstructs masked node features to explore the rich attribute characteristics of POIs. Together, these modules enable MaskPOI to jointly capture the spatial and attribute information essential for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate MaskPOI's effectiveness in improving performance on downstream tasks such as functional zone classification and population density prediction. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of its components, highlighting MaskPOI as a powerful and versatile framework for POI representation learning.},

To address this, we propose {\textbackslash}method, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.

  abstract = {Generating trajectory data is among promising solutions to addressing privacy concerns, collection costs, and proprietary restrictions usually associated with human mobility analyses. However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.},

  abstract = {Pervasive integration of GPS-enabled devices and data acquisition technologies has led to an exponential increase in GPS trajectory data, fostering advancements in spatial-temporal data mining research. Nonetheless, GPS trajectories contain personal geolocation information, rendering serious privacy concerns when working with raw data. A promising approach to address this issue is trajectory generation, which involves replacing original data with generated, privacy-free alternatives. Despite the potential of trajectory generation, the complex nature of human behavior and its inherent stochastic characteristics pose challenges in generating high-quality trajectories. In this work, we propose a spatial-temporal diffusion probabilistic model for trajectory generation (DiffTraj). This model effectively combines the generative abilities of diffusion models with the spatial-temporal features derived from real trajectories. The core idea is to reconstruct and synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise through a reverse trajectory denoising process. Furthermore, we propose a Trajectory UNet (Traj-UNet) deep neural network to embed conditional information and accurately estimate noise levels during the reverse process. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that DiffTraj can be intuitively applied to generate high-fidelity trajectories while retaining the original distributions. Moreover, the generated results can support downstream trajectory analysis tasks and significantly outperform other methods in terms of geo-distribution evaluations.},

  abstract = {Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-\${\textbackslash}\{n{\textbackslash}\}\$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves model performance.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.},

  abstract = {Urban mobility analysis has been extensively studied in the past decade using a vast amount of GPS trajectory data, which reveals hidden patterns in movement and human activity within urban landscapes. Despite its significant value, the availability of such datasets often faces limitations due to privacy concerns, proprietary barriers, and quality inconsistencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a synthetic trajectory dataset with high fidelity, offering a general solution to these data accessibility issues. Specifically, the proposed dataset adopts a diffusion model as its synthesizer, with the primary aim of accurately emulating the spatial-temporal behavior of the original trajectory data. These synthesized data can retain the geo-distribution and statistical properties characteristic of real-world datasets. Through rigorous analysis and case studies, we validate the high similarity and utility between the proposed synthetic trajectory dataset and real-world counterparts. Such validation underscores the practicality of synthetic datasets for urban mobility analysis and advocates for its wider acceptance within the research community. Finally, we publicly release the trajectory synthesizer and datasets, aiming to enhance the quality and availability of synthetic trajectory datasets and encourage continued contributions to this rapidly evolving field. The dataset is released for public online availability https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SynMob.},
